<h2>AN OWN RELATION.</h2>

<h3>BY SOPHIE SWETT.</h3>

<p>The country-week girl came up the lane with her head in the air, so
Gideon, who was watching her from the crotch in the old sweet-apple
tree, afterwards remarked to little Adoniram.</p>

<p>After some hesitation Gideon dropped down at her feet. Aunt Esther had
especially enjoined it upon him to be kind to the country-week girl.
Aunt Esther <i>would</i> remember that he used to get under the bed when a
girl came to see Phemie; but that was when he was small.</p>

<p>"Is this Sweet Apple Hill? Be you Trueworthys?" demanded the girl,
looking critically at Gideon.</p>

<p>"Yes, 'm," said Gideon, and then reddened and scorned himself because he
had been overpolite. But the girl was tall for fourteen&mdash;"Grazella
Hickins, aged fourteen," the letter from the Country-week Committee had
read&mdash;and she wore a wide sash and a scarlet feather in her hat and
carried a pink parasol.</p>

<p>Phemie, who came around the corner of the house just then, saw at a
glance that the finery was shabby, but Gideon thought that Grazella
Hickins was very stylish.</p>

<p>Grazella dropped her bundle upon the grass opposite the front gate and
seated herself upon it, meditatively. She did not arise from it as
Phemie opened the gate, but she surveyed her with an air of friendly
criticism; Phemie was fourteen too.</p>

<p>"I like your looks real well," she remarked at length, with a trifle of
condescension. Her glance sought Gideon and little Adoniram, who peeped
from behind the friendly shelter of the big black-currant bush. "I think
boys are kind of&mdash;middling," she added. It was evident that a more
severe adjective than this had been withheld only from motives of
politeness. "I've got an own relation, though, that's an awful nice
boy&mdash;awful smart too; you never know what he's going to do next."</p>

<p>Little Adoniram pricked up his ears; Aunt Esther had been known to say
that of him without meaning to be complimentary. City standards of
behavior seemed to be cheerfully different from those of Bayberry
Corner.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have said a word if Jicksy could have come too," continued
Grazella, and her snapping black eyes slowly filled with tears. "A
cousin is a real comfort."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you didn't want to come?" asked Phemie, in a
disappointed tone.</p>

<p>"I'm in the newspaper business; 'twas kind of risky to leave it;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_954" id="Page_954">[Pg 954]</a></span>
there's so many pushin' in. But they don't want me to home; mother she's
married again, and <i>he</i> don't like me. Jicksy is all I've got that's
really my own. If he could have come too&mdash;"</p>

<p>She swallowed a lump in her throat with determination, and raised her
eyes to the old sweet apple-tree whose fruit was yellowing in the August
sunshine.</p>

<p>"Are them apples?" she asked. "They ain't near so shiny and handsome as
Judy Magrath keeps on her stand; Judy shines 'em with her apron. I never
was in the country before, and I don't know as I'm going to like it. But
I'm run down, they say, and I've got a holler cough, so I had to come."</p>

<p>Phemie had almost begun to wish that they had not taken a country-week
girl; but now she noticed, suddenly, the meagreness of the tall form,
and the deep hollows under the snapping black eyes, and repented. It was
proverbial that people grew plump and strong on Sweet Apple Hill.</p>

<p>Aunt Esther came out, and the girl's manner softened under the influence
of her tactful kindness. She seemed to like Grandpa Trueworthy too; she
said she had a grandpa once, and 'twas the most she ever did have that
was like other folks.</p>

<p>But, after all, it was she and Gideon who seemed most congenial. Gideon
explained, with a gravely approving wag of the head, that she was
"business." Gideon flattered himself that he had abilities in that line,
and he was cultivating them diligently. He had not expected to get any
hints from a girl; but the country-week girl was assistant at a
newspaper stand, and she also "tended" for Judy Magrath when Judy, as
she explained with sad and severe head-shakings, was obliged to go to a
funeral; but it was Judy's only infirmity, she added, very charitably.</p>

<p>Of course girls did not generally have such business opportunities as
these, and it was Gideon's opinion that she was "considerable of a girl,
anyhow." It must be confessed that Aunt Esther was a little anxious, and
the minister expressed a doubtful hope that she would not prove "a
corrupting influence." Gideon told Grazella all his business plans,
which Phemie never cared to listen to. It was after tea one evening, and
he and Grazella were sitting on the orchard wall, while Phemie and
little Adoniram shook the old damson-plum-tree. He told her of the
contract he had made with the owners of the canning factory at Bayberry
Port, to supply them with berries for the whole season, and, what he
wouldn't tell any fellow, of the great find he had made&mdash;a blackberry
thicket over on the other side of Doughnut Hill, almost an acre, and the
berries just beginning to ripen! He was going to sell the plums off his
trees, too, and, later on, his crab-apples, he'd got a business opening,
she'd better believe.</p>

<p>Grazella's eyes snapped, and her thin, sallow cheeks reddened suddenly.
"You'd ought to have a partner!" she cried.</p>

<p>Gideon shook his head doubtfully. "It's awful risky takin' partners," he
said. "If they ain't smart, you have to do all the work; if they are,
they are apt to cheat you."</p>

<p>"Jicksy!" suggested Grazella, wistfully, breathlessly. "I&mdash;I've got a
job for him up here&mdash;a little one; I didn't tell, because I was afraid
your aunt wouldn't ask me to stay another week if she knew; she's scairt
of me, and I expect she'd be scairter of Jicksy." (The country-week
girl's eyes were sharp.) "Mr. Snell, across the field, said he'd give
him his board to help him take care of his cattle, and I heard they were
wanting a boy to blow the organ in church. It wouldn't suit Jicksy to
throw away his talents workin' for his board; but he's crazy for the
country, and the doctor said 'twould be the makin' of him, account of
his heart beatin' too fast, and whatever he has to eat he always thinks
it enough to go 'round amongst a dozen that's poorer than him. He could
blow the organ, for when he belonged to the show he blew up the fat
man&mdash;all the ingy-rubber fixin's that made him fat, you know, every day:
and once he worked for a balloon-man. But if you'd take him for a
partner in your business&mdash;"</p>

<p>Grazella's eyes were so anxious that Gideon found it hard to shake his
head with the proper decision, although he felt strongly doubtful
whether Jicksy were "the man for his money."</p>

<p>"He's coming up to Mr. Snell's, anyway," said Grazella, made hopeful by
Gideon's evident weakness. "And when you see how smart he is, you'll say
you wouldn't have nobody else for a partner! He ain't jest common folks,
like you and me, anyhow, Jicksy ain't; his adopted father was a
lion-tamer in a circus, awful famous and talented, and Jicksy himself
has rode elephants and camels, and travelled 'round in the
boa-constructor's cage, and his own uncle is the wild man of the South
Seas!"</p>

<p>Gideon's prudent mind still hesitated; he doubted whether these
wonderful opportunities especially fitted a boy for the berry business.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when Jicksy arrived, he succeeded in convincing Gideon of
his desirability as a partner, and this in spite of the fact that his
appearance was not pleasing. His face was so thin and wizened that it
made him look like a little old man, and his black hair standing upright
above the snapping black eyes, that were remarkably like Grazella's,
gave him a fierce and combative aspect. Farmer Snell professed himself
satisfied; he said he was up an' comin' if he wa'n't very
likely-lookin'. And he secured the position of organ-blower at the
village church, an easy matter, because it was not coveted by the
Bayberry boys, owing to the fact that the wind in the ancient instrument
would occasionally give out with an appalling screech, and the luckless
and innocent blower was always soundly cuffed therefor by the sexton,
who held that this summary measure was necessary to preserve the public
respect for the organ&mdash;which the parish hoped to sell to a struggling
young church at the Port as soon as it could afford a new one.</p>

<p>And Aunt Esther did invite Grazella to stay another week. The neighbors
thought the reason that she gave a very queer one&mdash;because she was kept
awake nights by the hard little cough in the room next hers.</p>

<p>Gideon had been influenced by Jicksy's ready tongue. He confided to
Phemie that there ought to be one good talker in a business firm, and
also by the fact that he didn't expect an equal share of the profits,
but realized the value of Gideon's capital and experience. (Gideon had
seven dollars and fifty-nine cents, which he kept tucked away under the
ticking of his bed and counted over every night.)</p>

<p>Jicksy wasn't extravagant either, as Gideon had feared that he would be.
He discovered at once that they were paying Steve Pennyphair, the
stage-driver, too much for carrying the berries to the Port. Freedom
Towle, the milkman, would carry them among his cans for half as much.
Gideon had thought of asking Towle, but the fact was Bobby Towle often
went on the route instead of his father, and Bobby was known to be
greedy. Jicksy managed that difficulty by fastening some canvas (old
hay-caps) securely over the tops of the baskets. Gideon had thought of
the plan; he had lain awake half of two nights reckoning how large a
hole the price of canvas enough would make in that seven dollars and
fifty-nine cents; he hadn't thought of these old hay-caps that Jicksy
had found in the barn chamber.</p>

<p>Jicksy was truly honest, and before the end of the second week of the
partnership he began to wonder whether an ability to think of things
ought not to offset experience; and he had brought home from the Port
library a very large book on the relations of capital and labor. But
before he had settled these knotty problems of the partnership in his
mind something happened that caused a great excitement at Bayberry
Corner, and made many people say they were glad they had known better
than to take country-week children, for if the girl had not been sent to
Sweet Apple Hill the boy would not have come. Jicksy had gone to the
canning factory at the Port to collect a bill, and he had not returned.
The amount of the bill was twenty-four dollars and sixty-four cents;
Gideon had "done" the addition seven times over, and then had Phemie do
it; strangely enough, thought Gideon, Phemie had "a head for figures."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_955" id="Page_955">[Pg 955]</a></span>
He had run a pitchfork into his foot, so he could not go and collect the
money himself, and although he had a prudent mind, he had not thought of
distrusting his partner. But he had heard from the factory that Jicksy
had collected the money&mdash;and he had disappeared.</p>

<p>As soon as the fact became known there was another development; the
minister's watch was also missing. Jicksy had blown the organ for three
services with fidelity and success; only once had that fatal scream
interrupted the devotions of the congregation, and then it was in a mild
and mitigated form. But after the evening service the minister had
thrust his watch, which he kept on the desk while he preached, into the
absurd little pocket with a tight little elastic and a blue ribbon bow
which his wife had made in the embroidered cover of his sermon-case. He
explained that he put it there because he knew that his wife liked to
have him (he was young and newly married), and therefore he was sure
that his memory was not at fault. He had carelessly left the sermon-case
on the desk, where the sexton had found it&mdash;without the watch. The boy
who blew the organ was the only one who had an opportunity to take it.
It was the day after this loss that Jicksy took "French leave"; he had
"killed two birds with one stone," Bayberry people said.</p>

<p>Grazella's eyes snapped continually; grandpa said she was as hoppin' as
a parched pea. She said folks had ought to be ashamed of themselves that
could b'lieve such things of Jicksy. The probabilities of the case made
no impression whatever on Grazella's mind.</p>

<p>The minister's wife, who had taken a fancy to the girl, offered her
consolation at the sewing circle, which met at the Trueworthys' two days
after Jicksy's departure.</p>

<p>"You mustn't think we hold you responsible for what he has done," she
said, gently. "He is only your cousin."</p>

<p>Grazella stood up, her little bony cheeks aflame. "He ain't neither only
my cousin. I just let on, because he'd got up in the world, and I didn't
want folks heavin' it at him that he had a sister that tended for Judy
Magrath. He's my own brother as ever was in the world, and when folks
are thinkin' he's a <i>thief</i>, I just want 'em to know that he's my
brother. Jicksy is smarter'n other folks, and you never know what he'll
do next; but I told Gideon that he'd find him an awful square partner,
and I stick to it&mdash;now."</p>

<p>There were melancholy head-shakings in the sewing circle; in fact, the
whole circle shook its head as one woman; but it was whispered that the
girl was probably honest; that the little scamp had deceived her, as he
deceived others.</p>

<p>But at that very time an exciting rumor was circulating about Bayberry
Corner. Iky Snell shouted it at the open window of the room where the
sewing circle sat at supper.</p>

<p>A boy had been seen on the turnpike-road coming towards Sweet Apple
Hill, leading a giraffe.</p>

<p>"Looks as if he had a circus procession all to himself," declared Iky,
enviously; and if several persons who had seen him were not very greatly
mistaken, the boy was Jicksy.</p>

<p>"If some boys should come home leadin' a giraffe, why, I might be kind
of surprised," remarked grandpa; "but it does seem jest like Jicksy."</p>

<p>Grazella, who had been trying to swallow blackberry tart mingled with
tears, tried very hard to be calm, though her thin little face paled and
flushed. "You never know what Jicksy will do next," she said, proudly.</p>

<p>Sweet Apple Hill turned out; so did half Bayberry Corner; every one ran
towards the turnpike-road; even the sewing-circle supper-table was
deserted in undignified haste.</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> Jicksy, footsore and begrimed, and accommodating his gait to
the tread of a creature whose body seemed to be set upon stilts, and
whose neck might, as Phemie declared, be tied into a double bow-knot.
The animal was lame, and its head wagged in a curious fashion.</p>

<p>Gideon, seeing his partner afar off, felt a thrill of delight in his
honesty, which seemed probable since he was returning, but it was
followed by a painful doubt concerning his "business bump." Jicksy had
wished to buy Aaron Green's old horse, which Aaron would sell for twenty
dollars. It was a good horse for the money, and it could easily be kept
on their little farm; and the old blue cart in the barn could be
repaired at very small expense, and perhaps what Jicksy said was
true&mdash;that you had to have some style to a business to advertise it.
Nevertheless, Gideon had not consented to buy Aaron Green's horse; he
had felt that the twenty-four dollars and sixty-four cents must go under
his bed-ticking with the seven dollars and fifty-nine cents, where he
could count it every night. He felt a wild fear that Jicksy had bought
the giraffe to draw the blue cart, following his theory that there was
nothing like attracting attention to your business.</p>

<p>"I didn't run away!" Jicksy was saying angrily, as Gideon pressed
through the crowd. "Gid understood that it was business that kept me,
didn't you Gid?" But Gideon looked away; he couldn't say that he had
understood, and he was certain that he didn't understand now about that
giraffe.</p>

<p>"I heard that McColloh's show was stranded down to Westport; that's the
show I b'longed to once; couldn't pay their bills, and the sheriff was
after 'em; I thought maybe I could get a horse, cheap." There was
silence as the crowd listened to Jicksy's explanation; only now and then
a shrill question interrupted him. "Foot it? Of course I did." (It was
twenty miles to Westport.) "I wasn't goin' to fool away the firm's
money. Comin' back I had the giraffe; they're slow travellers, and
Squashy is lame. There wasn't any horse that I could buy&mdash;trained horses
and Shetland-ponies, and they were selling high. Squashy is lame and
old, and sometimes he gets ugly." (The crowd withdrew from Squashy's
vicinity.) "Me and Nick Pridgett could always manage him. Nick is
partner in a show now, and it's down to Hebron. I saw that in the paper.
When Jim McColloh says to me, 'There's old Squashy; gets on to his tears
worse than ever; you can have him for twenty dollars if you want him.' A
giraffe for twenty dollars! If you knew the show business as well as I
do you'd know that was a big bargain." Jicksy addressed this remark to
Gideon, but his partner was unresponsive; he saw, in fancy, the giraffe
harnessed to the old blue cart, the equipage was attended by crowds; but
the berry business was not a circus. "Quicker 'n scat I give him the
money," pursued Jicksy, and Gideon groaned. "Then I telegraphed to Nick
Pridgett, 'Will you pay fifty dollars for Squashy?' 'Bring him along and
the money is yours,' telegraphs Nick. So I'm bringin' him along." The
crowd cheered; Gideon's face brightened; this <i>was</i> business. "And I've
got to bring him along pretty lively," continued Jicksy, "for there
isn't a building in town big enough to hold him, unless it's the
church."</p>

<p>That made every one think of the watch; but, queerly enough, just at
that moment the minister was seen running in a very undignified manner
up the lane. In dressing to officiate at a wedding at the Port he had
discovered his watch, chain, and all, in one of his coat-tail pockets.
He said that, knowing it was his duty to put it in some unusual place,
and being absent-minded, he had stowed it away there.</p>

<p>Grazella hushed every one's exclamations before they reached Jicksy's
ears. She said her cousin was proud, and she didn't want him to know
that he had been suspected of stealing. Her cousin! The sewing-circle
ladies looked at each other; but she held her head in the air, and
looked so stern that no one dared, or had the heart to contradict her.
Jicksy was up in the world again, and she was not going to have him
dragged down by a sister who had tended for Judy Magrath! When Jicksy
returned from Westport, bringing a dollar's worth of blue paint to paint
the old cart, the partnership was settled upon a firm basis. Jicksy said
Bayberry Corner was a place that suited him "down to the ground," and
the minister's wife had taken Grazella to live with her. That made him
want to stay; they hadn't any real own folks, but just each other.
Gideon said that seeing Jicksy had put some capital into the business,
as you might say, henceforth they would share and share alike.</p>

<p>he death last spring, at Astrakhan, in southeastern Russia, of Captain
Nicholas Novikoff, a retired naval officer, recalls some of the
principal events of the Crimean war. Novikoff was the last survivor of a
famous quartet of heroes. They were cabin-boys on board ships of the
Russian Black Sea fleet at the outbreak of the war against Turkey, in
1853, and their ages ranged at the time from twelve to fourteen years.
The other three were Vasili Rinitzik, Ivan Robert, and Sergius
Farasiouk.</p>

<p>The day after the Russian defeat at the Alma, on September 20, 1854,
Menschikoff, Commander-in-chief, sent peremptory orders to Admiral
Korniloff in Sebastopol, the great Crimean port of war, to sink in the
passage, at the entry of the "Roads," his five oldest line-of-battle
ships and two frigates, in order to prevent the Anglo-French fleet from
forcing an entrance. These orders were carried out on the night of
September 22d. The doomed vessels, pierced with holes, sank in the
roadstead in the presence of their crews, drawn up in parade formation
alongshore. Scarcely a dry eye watched the mournful event. The sailors
and marines who had humbled the Turk but a few months before in the
harbor of Sinope now bent their energies to the defense of Russia's
great stronghold. The men who had navigated and fought the Czar's
proudest men-of-war were assigned to the duty of throwing up
intrenchments, constructing subterranean mines, handling heavy siege
ordnance, and of performing numerous other tasks incident to warfare
ashore.</p>

<p>Among those brave defenders of the great fortress, our four young heroes
soon distinguished themselves by their splendid courage and devotion.
Their share in the defense of Sebastopol was a modest one, but it
consisted, nevertheless, of eleven months' arduous service in the
casemates of the Malakhoff and the Redan, during which time two of their
number were seriously disabled. Novikoff made the finest record of all
by creeping, unperceived during a fog, close to the advance ranks of the
British, opposite the Redan fort, late in June of 1855, and discovering
the pickets asleep. He promptly returned with the information, and this
enabled the besieged to make a successful sally, resulting in the
capture of forty Englishmen.</p>

<p>Farasiouk and Rinitzik were engaged in the Malakhoff fort in the
transport of munitions, but during the great bombardment in June 18th
they were suddenly called to help man a fifty-pound gun, and performed
this duty with such pluck and fortitude that Admiral Nakhimoff
personally complimented them, and promised them the Cross of Merit. The
final assault on the fortress, which culminated in its capture, saw the
boys on the ramparts one night, almost in the front ranks of the
defenders. Two of them, Robert and Farasiouk, had just recovered from
wounds received three weeks earlier. They had been sent to the Redan
fort to aid in the establishment of a lazeretto, and, when the English
rather unexpectedly appeared on the parapets in great force, every
available man among the defenders, including even the hospital
assistants, rushed to the front. The overwhelming defeat of Colonel
Wyndham's columns was due to the desperate bravery of the Redan's
defenders, who, though greatly outnumbered, fought like demons. The four
cabin-boys were in the thick of the fight, Novikoff especially
distinguishing himself by deftly tripping up an English lieutenant, and
forcing him at the pistol's point to surrender his sword.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of peace, among the first to benefit from the imperial
good-will and gratitude were the four sailor lads. The Emperor pinned a
gold medal on each boy's breast, and took them under his special
protection. Although they were of humble birth, he placed them in the
School of Naval Cadets at St. Petersburg, and launched them on an
honorable career in the service of their country. Three of them lived to
attain the rank of Captain in the Russian navy. The fourth, Farasiouk,
was drowned shortly after his promotion to lieutenant in the very harbor
of Sebastopol, which he had helped so bravely to defend.</p>

<h2><a name="GREAT_MENS_SONS" id="GREAT_MENS_SONS"></a>GREAT MEN'S SONS.</h2>

<h3>BY ELBRIDGE S. BROOKS.</h3>

<h3>THE SON OF CROMWELL.</h3>

<p>In the famous old English village of St. Ives&mdash;famous because of a
certain nursery rhyme concerning a man who, travelling toward the town,
met seven wives with their cats and kits&mdash;there once lived a farmer who,
later in his life, became more famous than St. Ives itself.</p>

<p>Out West they would have called him a ranchman. He was really a cattle
farmer, with a big grazing farm that lay along the river Ouse, in what
is termed "the fen country" of England. Here, where the Ouse slipped
thickly and lazily through those low, green, boggy, marshy fields called
the fens, this farmer raised his beef, his pork, and his mutton; and
here lived his son Richard, as lazy and sluggish of nature as the river
along whose banks he lounged or fished or wandered as a boy, until it
was time to send him off to Felsted School, in Essex, where his
brothers, before and after him, were placed for such education as those
days provided.</p>

<p>A slow, good-natured, easy-going fellow was this boy Dick&mdash;"lazy Dick,"
his father often called him. He was neither as bright in mind or manner
as his younger brother Harry, nor as promising a lad as his elder
brother Robert. Robin was what this elder brother was called; he was the
delight and hope of his fond father&mdash;then called by his neighbors "the
Lord of the Fens," because of the stand he took against the King's
threatened "improvement" of the marshy fen-lands. To-day the world
honors and revels that sturdy farmer of the fens as Britain's mightiest
man&mdash;Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England.</p>

<p>We catch a few glimpses&mdash;not many, unfortunately&mdash;of the quiet home at
St. Ives, in which the Cromwell boys and girls lived. It was a happy and
united home, blessed with a mother whom her children revered, and having
as its head a father they honored and never dared to disobey.</p>

<p>But fathers in those days&mdash;two hundred and fifty years and more
ago&mdash;though stern in their ways with children, were as fond and as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_957" id="Page_957">[Pg 957]</a></span>
loving as are the fathers of to-day, and Cromwell the farmer, Cromwell
the General, Cromwell the Lord Protector, loved his children dearly, and
labored for their good alike in the great palace at Whitehall as in the
low, timber-framed house upon the one street of St. Ives, where the
willows shivered in the wind, and the cattle grazed and fattened upon
the wide marshy meadows that lined the sluggish Ouse.</p>

<p>How little Dick Cromwell fared as a boy at St. Ives we have little means
of knowing. When he was ten years old&mdash;in the year 1636&mdash;the Cromwells
moved into a bigger house at Ely, fifteen miles away. It was called Ely
from the eels that wriggled about in the muddy Ouse, and is that famous
cathedral town of the fens where King Canute, who tried to order back
the tide, once bade his rowers stop his boat that he might hear the
monks of the cathedral sing.</p>

<p>Probably boy Dick thought more of bobbing for eels in the Ouse than of
King Canute and the monks; for there were no monks singing in England
when Richard Cromwell was a boy. There was soon to be no King in
England, either, and in that great uprising against principalities and
powers Dick Cromwell's father was to bear an important part.</p>

<p>We would like to know more of Richard Cromwell's boyhood. We would like
to know how he lived and what he did as a small boy on that cattle farm
among the fens at St. Ives, and at the more spacious homestead in the
shadow of the great gray towers of Ely Cathedral. We would like to know
whether he liked sport, as most boys do, or whether he was too lazy to
exert himself at play. We would like to know how he studied, and what he
learned at the Free Grammar School at Felsted, where, one after the
other, four of the Cromwell boys were sent; whether he loved football as
much as his father did, and became a champion full-back as his father
did when he was a boy.</p>

<p>I am afraid Richard Cromwell was just as careless at his books as at the
later duties that came to him; for, from things that have come down to
us, we know how his busy father, who was as ambitious for his boys as
all fathers are, had but little patience with lazybones anywhere, and
reproved boy Dick for his carelessness as he found fault with young Mr.
Dick, in later years, for his shiftless ways.</p>

<p>Troublesome times came to England. The people rose in defence of their
rights. The King fell. The throne and crown were abolished. The
Parliament bent before the iron will of the people's champion, and from
the Captain of a troop and the General of an army the determined farmer
of the fens took the helm and steered his country through reefs and
breakers, until, under the leadership of Oliver Cromwell, the
commonwealth of England became the first power in Europe, unconquerable
on the land, invincible on the sea.</p>

<p>Step by step Cromwell rose to power. Against his own desire he rose, the
one strong man in England. And, as he advanced, his family rose with him
into notice and position. One by one the older boys died. Robert, a
promising lad of seventeen, died at Felsted School; Oliver, the second
son, named for his father and a Captain in the cavalry, died just before
the great victory of Marston Moor, and Richard Cromwell thus became the
eldest living son, heir to the estates, successor in power, but never
heir to the fame that his mighty father attained.</p>

<p>For there was in "lazy Dick" nothing of his father's masterful manner or
genius in leadership, nothing of the display and vast hospitality that
made famous his ancestor, known as "the Golden Knight of Hinchinbrook,"
nothing of the dash and daring that marked his more remote ancestor,
"Diamond Dick," who unhorsed all his rivals at a tournament, and so
defended the king's colors that the pleased monarch, bluff King Henry
the Eighth, called the victorious champion his "diamond."</p>

<p>We are not even certain that Richard Cromwell fought in the wars against
the King, as did his brother Oliver and Henry. We cannot find that he
desired either the position or prominence that his father's rise to
greatness gave him. Richard Cromwell cared only to live and die a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_958" id="Page_958">[Pg 958]</a></span>
quiet, inoffensive, lazy country squire. At any other time in the
history of the world he might easily have lived unknown, unhonored, and
unsung. It was his father's fame that brought him into notice; it was
because he had neither the will, the inclination, nor the ability to
take up his father's work, and carry it forward for the greatness and
glory of England, that to-day the world holds in such slight esteem this
quiet son of Cromwell.</p>

<p>We should not blame people for not doing what they cannot do. It may be,
indeed, that "lazy Dick" was not shiftless, though he was lazy, nor a
numbskull simply because he was not great. Richard Cromwell liked to
take things easy; he hated to be bothered; he liked to keep out of
trouble, and was willing to let the world wag as it would so long as he
had a comfortable home and nothing particular to do.</p>

<p>There is nothing really bad in this; but boys and men of that stamp, you
know, never help the world along. And I am afraid that "lazy Dick,"
notwithstanding all his opportunities and the high position to which he
was finally advanced, never did anything to help the world along. If a
good thing came in his way he took it, enjoyed it if he could, and got
out of it if it proved troublesome and laborious.</p>

<p>When he was twenty his father tried to make him a lawyer; but he soon
dropped that profession. He offered him a command in the army, but Dick
seems never to have accepted it. When he was twenty-three he married a
nice girl in Hampshire. Oliver Cromwell loved her dearly, but he and her
father had their hands full trying to make Dick "toe the mark."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/ill_005.jpg" width="600" height="395" alt="RICHARD PREFERRED HUNTING TO POLITICS." title="" />
<span class="caption">RICHARD PREFERRED HUNTING TO POLITICS.</span>
</div>

<p>Whenever he could, Richard Cromwell would slip away from the work his
father wished him to do and go out hunting, or have a good time with
other rich do-nothings at his Hampshire farm. He disliked the almost
kingly court of his father at Whitehall Palace, and though sent to
Parliament, he did little and said less. And when he was made one of his
father's chief advisers&mdash;a privy councillor&mdash;his counsels amounted to
nothing, and his position was simply what politicians call a sinecure.</p>

<p>When, at last, his great father's life went out, and England was left
without a head, Richard Cromwell was named as his successor, and made
Lord Protector. Lazy Dick became King of England, without the title, but
with more of power than many a King before and after him possessed.</p>

<p>But he had neither the skill nor the sense to hold what the people had
given him. I doubt if he cared either for the place or the power. And
they were his but a short time. Dissatisfaction broke into revolt. The
nation was divided. The King came to his own again. Charles the Second
was placed upon the throne from which his father had been hurled, and
Richard Cromwell, without a word of protest, without striking a blow for
his power, stepped quietly down from the Lord Protector's chair his
father had set up, and slipped back into private life, too weak to be
defended by his friends, too insignificant to be persecuted by his foes.</p>

<p>He lived to be an old, old man, and died at eighty-six amid his
rose-gardens at Cheshunt, near London, unhonored and disregarded by the
England his father had liberated, but which the son was too weak to
uphold as a free commonwealth.</p>

<p>We must not be too bard on "lazy Dick." He had not a spark of greatness
in him, and should not be blamed for failing to maintain his father's
glory. It is a hard thing for a small son to live up to the fame of a
great father. And yet the world does not take lack of ability into
account. Richard Cromwell to-day has no place in the world's esteem. His
name lives because he was his father's son; because he was a failure
where his father had been a success; and because his life was so sad and
stupid a sequel to the people's stand for liberty in the days made
glorious in English history by the might and power, the grandeur and
manliness, the strength and patriotism of England's greatest man&mdash;Oliver
Cromwell, great father of a small son.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_WATERMELON_TIDE" id="THE_WATERMELON_TIDE"></a>THE WATERMELON TIDE.</h2>

<h3>BY EARLE TRACY.</h3>

<p>The great still tide that comes from the Gulf when no one is expecting
it reached up through the marshes one summer night, and spread itself
over the banks of the bayou, and found numberless things in places of
safety, and when it was ready to go out again it took them along.</p>

<p>Among its discoveries was a schooner-load of watermelons, about which
Captain Lazare and the boss of the big farm had disagreed so radically
that the melons had been left in a pile on the landing to wait for other
transport. The tide charged itself with them, and when morning broke
they were on their way to New Orleans.</p>

<p>Bascom had been tossing in his sleep as the little <i>Mystery</i> did when
the tide went in one direction along Potosi Channel and the wind went in
the other. With the first glimmer of light he was up and down at the
beach.</p>

<p>"Me, but it's been high," he gasped, coming up from his first plunge and
leaning back in the water as if it were a steamer-chair. "It would be
beautiful to run out with in the <i>Mystery</i>&mdash;an' me goin' to pick figs
all day in them dumb ole trees! I wish the canning factory would bust!"</p>

<p>Bascom was ready for the hardest kind of work at sea, but things on
shore were unutterably lifeless to him, and how Captain Tony could have
contracted to sell his figs instead of letting the birds take care of
them was past Bascom's understanding.</p>

<p>While he was floating and thinking mournfully of the figs, one of the
watermelons struck him softly on the cheek. He bounded clear out of the
water with fright, and as he made for shore another melon came up under
him and sent him pelting through the shoals. He was not followed, and
when he felt grass under his feet, and realized that he had fled
shoreward for safety and that he had not been hurt at all, he felt very
queer.</p>

<p>"If they was popusses they'd be a-splashin'," he reasoned; "an' if they
was sharks they'd have eaten me&mdash;least-ways they wouldn't have been so
polite about lettin' me excuse myse'f. I wonder what they is?"</p>

<p>He moved gingerly into the deep water again, and at last swam out to
investigate. He could see two or three dark round surfaces letting the
tide sway them easily away from shore. At his approach they neither
dived nor turned to attack him. "They mighty tame," said Bascom, laying
his hand on one. "They&mdash;<i>they's watermelons</i>!"</p>

<p>"Where did you come from?" he asked, taking the nearest in his arms.
"What po' dumb idiot let you get away like this? Did you ax permission
to come here visitin' me? I'm mighty glad to see you, anyways. You's
jus' who I was a-thinkin' of."</p>

<p>He capered round them for a while, then gathered them all in a line
within his arm. They were too many for him, but the wrestle to keep them
from bobbing over or under and getting away was sheer delight. "Three
melons!" he repeated; "cooled in this high tide! Three of 'em! What'll
Captain Tony say?"</p>

<p>He was so interested in thinking of Captain Tony's surprise that the
outside melon escaped from him, and he could not get it again without
losing the other two.</p>

<p>"I'll come back for you," he promised; "you can't go far 'thouten your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_959" id="Page_959">[Pg 959]</a></span>
fins grow." He took the other two and put them under a clump of
palmettoes, where they would make no new acquaintances while he was
gone. "Don't know as anybody else is up," he said; "but they might be.
It was a terrible hot night."</p>

<p>As he waded out again over the sharp oyster-shells the sky had grown
blue instead of gray, and a brightness sprang across the water, touching
hundreds and hundreds of glistening green watermelons undulating with
the falling tide.</p>

<p>Bascom's heart stood still. He stopped right where he was, and his brown
face grew tense with round-eyed wonder. The water lapped against his
breast. He almost let it take him off his feet. "I knowed they was
called watermelons," he said, slowly, "but I never caught 'em growing in
the water by night before. How's we goin' to get 'em in.'"</p>

<p>He looked from the melons toward the shore, where Captain Tony's long
seine hung on the poles beside the submerged pier. "Usses can haul 'em
in," he said.</p>

<p>Although it was exceedingly early there was no time to lose. It would
take two good hours to get the melons in, and the people on the bay
would be only too glad to help in the rescuing as soon as they woke up.
"Folkses is always so interested in what I find," Bascom grumbled; but
for once no one troubled him. He roused Captain Tony, and they hitched
the net between two boats and, rowing apart, circled around the melons
with it, gathering them in, until they were fairly rafting them before
it toward the shore. The net bulged in a great crescent, and Bascom
could hardly keep his boat abreast of the Captain's. The weight they
were towing made it seem as if his oars were pulling through stiff clay.
No net on all the coast had ever had such a full haul before. Bascom and
the Captain exulted in it, even while their faces grew scarlet.</p>

<p>"We can'd take in anoder one," the Captain declared; "de net can'd stan'
de strain." And closing together as much as the mass between them would
permit, they pulled ashore and rolled the melons out in a line upon the
beach. The tide was going out so fast that each haul made a separate
rank farther and farther out from the high drift-mark in the grass.</p>

<p>It was glorious hard work, and before it was finished the sun had turned
the water violet, then red, then gold and blue, and yet no one had come
to take a share in the salvage, and no one had come to claim the melons.
"I tell you," said Bascom, as he wheeled the last barrow-load up from
the beach&mdash;"I tell you they's mascots, and they's come right in from the
deep sea. Do you reckon they's too many of 'em for usses to eat?"</p>

<p>The Captain straightened himself, and measured the heap of cracked
melons, which he had left out as he piled the good ones symmetrically
under one of the live-oaks. "Yo' boy," he said, "if yo' jus' made way
wid de busted ones I'd be paintin' a black ring roun' de mas' of de
little <i>Mystery</i> 'fo' sunset, an' w'ad would I do 'boud pickin' de figs
faw de cannin' factory?"</p>

<p>"O-h-h," groaned Bascom, "I'd forgot about the figs. Can't they wait
till we take these melons off in the <i>Mystery</i> and sell 'em?"</p>

<p>"De melons can wait, ya-as, now we got dem all safe," said the Captain.
"De cracked ones will not keep noway, an' de good ones will las' bettah
dan de figs. An' w'ad is mo' to de point, dere is de ownah of de melons
to consult."</p>

<p>"But he isn't here," Bascom said, "an' we don't know where he is. They
didn't bring his address with 'em when they come in on the tide."</p>

<p>"I reckon I know his address," the Captain answered, "an' maybe yo'
would, also, if yo' let yo'se'f t'ink 'boud id. De big tide washed dem
off de landin' up de bayou. Lazare was a-tellin' me yestahday dat he an'
de boss ad de big fahm had a quahl boud de price o' melons, an' Lazare,
who was to have take dem in de <i>Alphonsine</i>, he go off mad, an' de
melons dey stay in a pile on de landin', an' I was t'inkin' boud goin'
up to see de boss me aftah de figs was pick'. I reckon now de bes' way
is faw me to go ad once while yo' pick de figs."</p>

<p>"But we ought to start right now while the tide is goin' out," objected
Bascom.</p>

<p>"Dere will be oder tides, an' dey is waitin' faw de figs ad de factory,"
said the Captain, "so I fink yo' bettah go to pickin', boy"; and without
stopping for further persuasion from Bascom he got into his skiff and
headed toward the mouth of Bayou Porto.</p>

<p>As Bascom carried the last of the melons to add to the heap it slipped
from his hands accidentally, and split into rich red pieces on the sand.
"U-m," he said; "lucky it was a cracked one." He took it up to eat it in
the shade of the live-oak. "Too bad," he added, "after you was so
enterprisin' to start out by yourse'f that me an' Captain Tony couldn't
agree to take you right along. Queer how folkses can't agree 'bout you.
If it wasn't for them dumb ole figs! S'pose when I'm done eatin' I <i>got</i>
to go up an' go to pickin'. Seems like such a sailor as Captain Tony
hadn't ought to fuss with things on shore."</p>

<p>His arms were aching from the heavy pull, and they did not feel drawn
toward the sticky figs, and mud daubers were sure to be in the trees
ready to sting interfering people, and he had not finished with the
melon when Peter Pierre, or Peter <i>Peer</i>, as the Creoles pronounce it,
came hopping leisurely along the beach, with one leg wrapped around the
other like a stork's. He was a neighbor's boy, and had been sent to
borrow Captain Tony's axe. There would be no morning coffee at his house
until Captain Tony's axe had chopped wood enough to build a fire.</p>

<p>"H-o!" said Peter Peer.</p>

<p>"H-o!" replied Bascom.</p>

<p>"Whose is dose melons?" cried Peter Peer. "Wheah did dey come from?"</p>

<p>"Came down the bayou," said Bascom. "They's mine. Mine an' Captain
Tony's."</p>

<p>"Gimme one?"</p>

<p>"Nop," said Bascom.</p>

<p>"Sell one?"</p>

<p>"N-nop, I reckon not. They ain't so many as they look."</p>

<p>"Heap o' cracked ones," said Peter Peer. "I'll trade yo' my play boat
faw one."</p>

<p>"Eatin' the cracked ones," said Bascom, taking another mouthful; "they's
mighty sweet."</p>

<p>"Yo' can'd eat dem <i>all</i>!" cried Peter Peer, his eyes rolling hungrily
from side to side.</p>

<p>"Look a-here, kid," said Bascom; "if you want one so bad I'll tell you
what I'll do. I'll let you pick figs for 'em. I was wantin' to pick 'em
myse'f, but it looks like I got to stay and take charge of these. I'll
give you a cracked melon for every basket of figs you pick."</p>

<p>"All right," said Peter Peer; "gimme de basket."</p>

<p>Bascom gave him a corner of melon to seal the bargain and keep the
basket from looking too large, and Peter Peer was soon whistling in the
trees behind the Captain's house. Bascom had scarcely settled himself
under the live-oak when Sonny Ladnier and his younger brother came in
sight with their red-sailed cat-boat, bent on an early trip to Potosi.
They saw the pile of melons, and it drew them like an undertow.</p>

<p>"Wheah yo' ged all dem melons?" they shouted.</p>

<p>"Growed 'em," replied Bascom; "do you want some?"</p>

<p>"Yo' bet yo'!" cried Sonny, tying up the boat. "Hand one ovah."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"W'at faw? W'y, to eat."</p>

<p>"I mean, what will you give me?" Bascom explained.</p>

<p>"Two bits faw two."</p>

<p>Bascom shook his head. There was only one way in which those melons
could be had. After some argument Sonny and his little brother repaired
to the fig-trees, each with a chunk of melon in one hand and a basket in
the other. Sonny Ladnier was big enough to have tried to bully Bascom,
but the people on the bay had a respectable fondness for him, not to
mention his partner.</p>

<p>During the hour, Narcisse Fontaine, big Noel Roget, Rubier Peer, who
came to look for Peter, and Patrice Rodriguez, with his pointed beard
and his reputation for duelling, added themselves to Bascom's force
behind the Captain's house, and the figs were fairly charmed from the
trees. Bascom did not think it safe to leave the melon pile for more
than a moment at a time, and he was sitting alone beside it, and had
just cleaved open the crack of a long striped "rattlesnake," when a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_960" id="Page_960">[Pg 960]</a></span>
strange schooner passed by a length or two, then came about, and
anchored off the point. She was the <i>Luna May</i>, from Pass Christian, and
he had never seen her before. As three men got down in her tender he
could hear their voices as plainly as if they were talking to him.</p>

<p>"'Cose dey sell dem. Wat dey have dem faw?"</p>

<p>"Bud we got no money. We spen' it all las' night."</p>

<p>"We can trade 'im out of some. I give my knife faw one o' dem big ones.
It's a terrib' hot day. Dat little chap be mighty easy to bargain wid.
<i>Yo'</i> see."</p>

<p>"You see," echoed Bascom, chuckling, as they left their skiff, and came
sauntering up to him. "Somethin' I can do for you gentlemans to-day?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>"Whose is dese melons?" asked the first schooner-man.</p>

<p>"Mine, jus' now," said Bascom.</p>

<p>"Aw, get away."</p>

<p>"Well, they is."</p>

<p>"Den I reckon yo' lookin' faw a chance to get rid o' some o' dem."</p>

<p>"Not as I knows on," Bascom said.</p>

<p>"Wat?" cried the second schooner-man. "I'll give yo' dis." He took out a
big Spanish pocket-knife that opened with a spring. "Yo' can have it faw
t'ree of dem."</p>

<p>"I don't reckon I need any knife," Bascom said.</p>

<p>"Aw," said the third schooner-man, impatiently, "a lot of dem is good
faw not'ing. He got to give us some. If he ain't got de sense to trade
faw dem we take dem."</p>

<p>He spread Bascom out swiftly with his hands, and sat down on him,
directing his mates to pile melons in their skiff. After the first
instant Bascom did not offer the slightest resistance. He lay gathering
breath against the weight of the man on his chest, and when he was quite
sure of himself he lit it out again in a terrific howl for help. The man
clapped a hand on his mouth, but Bascom had no need to speak again. A
posse of men and boys came dashing round the house, some of them putting
down the baskets, and others brandishing sticks as they ran.</p>

<p>The schooner-men jumped into their skiff, but Patrice and Rubier and
Noel and Sonny Ladnier rushed into the water after them, and brought
them back. A dozen hands rescued the stolen melons, while with Irish
expletives and Creole fierceness Patrice pounded the biggest man as a
preparation to bidding them good-by. The crowd was following his
example, and it would have gone hard with the strangers if Bascom had
not had a different mind.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;MAKE &#39;EM PICK YOUR FIGS!&quot; HE SHOUTED, &quot;MAKE EM PICK YOUR FIGS!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Make 'em pick your figs!" he shouted. "Make 'em pick your figs! They'll
look handsome in the trees! Make 'em pick for you!"</p>

<p>The cry found favor, and the verdict became, "If yo' want to go free yo'
got to pick de figs!"</p>

<p>When Captain Tony and the boss of the big farm approached the point, and
saw a strange schooner anchored there, the Captain felt anxious. "I hope
de boys not havin' troubl'," he said. "I don' see w'at dat boat wan'
stop dere faw."</p>

<p>As they landed, Bascom met them and explained. "I've got the crew of
that schooner pickin' figs for me, an' some of the boys from round here
is watchin' that they do it lively. They was honin' for some cracked
watermelons, an' I thought they'd better do a little work, seein' as
they got out of temper."</p>

<p>The boss was a Northern man. He looked at Bascom's agile weather-beaten
figure, and they all went round to see the force of overseers and the
three men in the trees. "That's about the way I have to work it," he
said. "More overseers than men; but how do yours manage to make the men
work so lively?"</p>

<p>"Ho!" said Bascom, "easy enough. They're workin' by the job. Can't go
till they're done."</p>

<p>But it was not until Patrice told why the strangers sat so glum and warm
and active in the trees that the Captain and the boss understood.</p>

<p>"Yo' boy," said the Captain, as they went back to the melon-pile, "an'
yo' nevah picked a fig yo'se'f?"</p>

<p>"Not a one," said Bascom, candidly. "The boys came along at first an'
wanted to pick for cracked melons, an' then 'bout the time they was
gettin' tired this schooner hove in sight. After I begun to have
comp'ny, looked like it was best for me to watch the melons."</p>

<p>"And before?" laughed the boss.</p>

<p>"I'd had the misfortune to drop one," Bascom said. "It busted, and I was
lookin' after the pieces."</p>

<p>The boss clapped Bascom on the shoulder. "You're the man I've been
hunting for down here," he declared. "Don't you want to come up and help
me run the farm?"</p>

<p>Bascom looked over at the little <i>Mystery</i>, the deep blue of the bay,
and the tree fringe on Deer Island, beyond which lay the Gulf.</p>

<p>"I reckon they'd have to be a mighty long calm," he answered; "wouldn't
they, Cap'n Tony?"</p>

<p>"They suah would," the Captain agreed. "In sailin' weathah me an'
Bascom mostly sails."</p>

<p>They counted the melons as they loaded them on board the <i>Mystery</i>,
agreed on a rate of salvage and a price, and arranged for future
dealings as the crop went on. The schooner-men finished their work, and
Bascom paid off the overseers generously; then the <i>Mystery</i> raced the
<i>Luna May</i> to the bridge, and passed through first.</p>

<p>"Well," sighed Bascom, when they had left the figs at the
canning-factory, and their faces were turned toward the welcome reaches
between Potosi and New Orleans, "if it hadn't a-been for that honey of a
tide I'd be up in them dumb ole trees a-studyin' 'bout pickin' dem
figs."</p>

<h3>BY ELLEN DOUGLAS DELAND.</h3>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p>It was true, then. Neal had gone.</p>

<p>Cynthia went to her mother's room and told her what Janet had said.</p>

<p>"It is what I feared," cried Mrs. Franklin: "he has left me forever! My
dear and only brother! And where is he? Cynthia, Cynthia, why did he go?
It almost makes me think he may have taken the money."</p>

<p>"Mamma, how can you!" exclaimed Cynthia, indignantly. "Neal never took
it. I&mdash;I&mdash;oh, I <i>know</i> he didn't take it! Can't you believe me, mamma?"
She was crying.</p>

<p>"Dear child," said Mrs. Franklin, looking at her affectionately, "you
have more faith in him than I have. But this running away is so much
against him, Cynthia. If he had been innocent, would he not have braved
it out?"</p>

<p>"No; he is so proud, mamma. That is the reason he went, I am sure. He
thought papa suspected him. Oh, why did papa ever think it? Why did he
say anything to Edith for Janet to hear?"</p>

<p>"Hush, dear. Your father spoke thoughtlessly, but it was natural; of
course it was natural. But Neal should not have gone. It is a false kind
of pride. If he is innocent he should have the pride of innocence and
stay here."</p>

<p>It was what they all said. Cynthia went from one to the other, trying to
convince them and to imbue them with her own belief in Neal, but she
could not. Even Jack, her beloved twin-brother, was on the other side.</p>

<p>"Of course I want to believe in Neal, Cynth," he said. "I like him, and
I never supposed before he'd do a low-down thing like this. In fact, I
can't really believe it now. But why on earth did the fellow run away?
If he came by the money all fair and square, why under the sun didn't he
say so, instead of shutting himself up like an oyster, and never letting
on where he got it?"</p>

<p>"He had his reasons," persisted Cynthia. "Oh, Jack, can't you believe
me? You always used to believe me."</p>

<p>"Well, you used to tell a fellow more than you do now. You get mighty
shut up yourself now and then. You won't tell me what you're going to do
with Aunt Betsey's money, or why you didn't buy a watch, or anything.
I'm sure I don't want you to if you don't want to, but there's no reason
why I should always think as you do."</p>

<p>If they had not been sitting side by side Jack could not have failed to
notice the peculiar expression that came into Cynthia's face when he
mentioned Aunt Betsey's present. They were on the stone wall which
crossed the river path. Bob was with them, darting hither and thither,
perhaps in the vain hope of finding his master.</p>

<p>"I don't need a watch, I've told you over and over again," said Cynthia.
"But oh, Jack, I wish you would agree with me! Indeed, Neal is honest."</p>

<p>"I believe he is myself, on the whole," said Jack at last; "but it's a
mighty queer thing he doesn't own up and tell where he got that money,
and he's a great ass not to. You see, the postmaster thinks that perhaps
the package did come from Aunt Betsey, and Neal paid gold just a few
days later. Of course it looks queer."</p>

<p>It was the same way with Edith. She would not be convinced, and after a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_962" id="Page_962">[Pg 962]</a></span>
vain argument with her Cynthia retired to the only place where she was
sure of being undisturbed, and cried until her eyes smarted and her head
ached. It was to the garret that she went when she wished to be alone,
and, amid the piles of empty paper boxes and bars of soap and all the
varied possessions that were stored there, she sat and thought over the
matter.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill_007.jpg" width="500" height="399" alt="&quot;OUGHT I TO TELL?&quot; SHE SAID AGAIN AND AGAIN." title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;OUGHT I TO TELL?&quot; SHE SAID AGAIN AND AGAIN.</span>
</div>

<p>"Ought I to tell?" she said again and again, speaking in a hoarse
whisper. "Oh, why did I ever promise?"</p>

<p>For Cynthia had at last prevailed upon Neal to borrow her money to pay
Bronson with, and had promised that she would not tell, and Cynthia had
a very strict sense of honor.</p>

<p>"Ought I to tell?" she repeated. "No; a promise is a promise, and I have
no right to break it. I was silly, I was idiotic ever to promise such a
thing, but how did I know it was coming out this way? Perhaps he will
come back soon; then I can make him tell."</p>

<p>But Neal did not come back. Instead of that, the next morning Mrs.
Franklin received a letter from him. He repeated the same words. He
could not stay where he was insulted. If they could not believe him he
would go. He had a perfect right to use the money which he had paid for
the money-order, and he would never condescend to explain where he got
it. He was visiting a friend at present, but he was going at once in
search of some work. He intended to support himself henceforth.</p>

<p>It was a very absurd letter, and it made Mr. Franklin more angry than
ever and his wife more distressed.</p>

<p>"It is perfect nonsense," said he. "The boy is not of age and he can be
stopped. I will write at once to his guardians. In the mean time we will
look him up in Boston; from the postmark I suppose he is there."</p>

<p>"One of his guardians is abroad, and the other is that Quaker cousin of
my mother's," sighed Mrs. Franklin.</p>

<p>"Give me his address, and don't worry, Hester. The affair will come
around all right, I have no doubt. He is a headstrong boy and he needs a
leash."</p>

<p>They could not find him in Boston. On going to the houses of his various
friends there they learned that he had spent the night with one of them,
but had left to go to his guardian in Philadelphia, they said.</p>

<p>"I am inclined to let it stand as it is," said Mr. Franklin, when he
returned; "if he has gone to Philadelphia let him stay there. His old
guardian will probably keep him in better order than we can; perhaps it
will be better not to interfere. I don't want to prejudice him against
the boy, and yet how can I explain why he left here? He can tell his own
story."</p>

<p>His wife, however, wrote a letter to her brother, and addressed it to
the care of her cousin, William Carpenter, of Philadelphia. She hoped
for an answer, but none came, and in a few days Mr. Franklin wrote to
Mr. Carpenter, asking if his brother-in-law had arrived, and then,
without waiting for a reply, he concluded to go himself to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The following Sunday was Easter day&mdash;it came late this year. Cynthia,
sitting in the Franklin pew, saw to her dismay Tony Bronson on the other
side of the church. He was with the Morgans.</p>

<p>"Dear me," thought Cynthia, "there will be more trouble now that he has
come, for he will tell hateful things about Neal, I'm sure. I do hope
Edith won't see him."</p>

<p>Her thoughts wandered during the service. When it was over, and the
congregation streamed out of church into the mild spring air, the
Morgans invited Edith to come home with them to dinner. This she agreed
to do, much to her sister's disgust; but Cynthia was still further
incensed when Edith came back that afternoon and announced, in a
would-be careless manner, that she had promised to drive with Tony
Bronson the next day.</p>

<p>"Why, Edith!" said Cynthia, indignantly; "I shouldn't think you would
have anything to do with that Bronson. He has been hateful to Neal."'</p>

<p>"I don't know why you should say that," returned Edith; "any one would
say that he had been exceedingly nice to Neal. He lent him all that
money, I'm sure. And, besides, what difference does it make? Neal has
behaved badly and run away. There is no reason why we should give up
people that Neal doesn't happen to like. Papa said the other day that
Tony Bronson was a very good sort of fellow, because he wasn't in that
last scrape of Neal's."</p>

<p>"Papa doesn't know a thing about him, and, at any rate, papa wouldn't
let you go to drive if he were at home. You know he wouldn't."</p>

<p>Mrs. Franklin came into the room just at this moment.</p>

<p>"Would not let Edith go to drive, Cynthia?" she said. "What do you mean,
dear?"</p>

<p>"Go to drive with strange men like that Bronson."</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" said Edith, crossly; "of course I can go. Papa never in
his life forbade my going to drive with any of the boys. How silly you
are, Cynthia!"</p>

<p>"Were you going to drive with Tony Bronson, Edith?" asked her
stepmother.</p>

<p>"Yes, I <i>am</i> going, to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I think I agree with Cynthia, then. I hardly think your father would
wish you to go."</p>

<p>"Why, how perfectly absurd!" exclaimed Edith, growing very angry. "There
has never been any question of my going to drive with any one who asked
me. Do you suppose I am going to give it up now?"</p>

<p>"I suppose you are, Edith," said Mrs. Franklin, quietly, but with
decision. "In your father's absence you are in my charge, and I do not
consider it desirable for you to drive with Mr. Bronson, nor with any
other young man whom you know so slightly. It is not in good taste, to
say the least. Please oblige me by giving it up this time. If I am
mistaken in your father's views on the subject you can go after he gets
home."</p>

<p>"I won't give it up!" exclaimed Edith, hotly. "Tony Bronson will be gone
when papa gets home, and, besides, what can I tell him? I've said I
would go."</p>

<p>"It is always possible to break an engagement of that kind," said her
mother; "you can tell him that you find I have made other plans for
you."</p>

<p>"I sha'n't tell him any such thing, Mrs. Franklin. I think it is too
bad. You have no right to order me."</p>

<p>"No right, Edith? I have at least a right to be spoken to with respect,
and you will oblige me by doing so. Please send a note to Mr. Bronson by
the man to-night."</p>

<p>She left the room, and Cynthia, who had restrained herself with great
difficulty, now gave vent to her feelings.</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can be so horrid to mamma, Edith. What are you
thinking of? And when she is so worried about Neal, too."</p>

<p>"Neal! Why should we suffer for Neal? She has no right to order me; I
won't be treated that way. The idea of it not being in good taste to
drive with Tony Bronson!"</p>

<p>"Don't be so absurd, Edith. Why, even I know papa wouldn't want you to.
It's very different from going with the Brenton boys that we have known
all our lives. You think I'm such an infant, but I know that much, and
any other time you would yourself. It is just because it is that hateful
Bronson. I can't understand what you and Gertrude see in him. You are
both so silly about him."</p>

<p>"I am not silly. I think he is very nice, that's all. I wish you
wouldn't interfere, Cynthia. You are silly to have such a prejudice
against him. I suppose I shall have to write that note, and I do hate to
give in to Mrs. Franklin. Oh, why, why, <i>why</i> did papa marry again?"</p>

<p>She raised her voice irritably as she said this, and added: "All this
fuss about Neal and everything! We never should have had it if the
Gordons hadn't come into the family. Oh, I beg your pardon, I didn't see
you." For standing in the doorway was her stepmother.</p>

<p>"I am sorry that the coming of the Gordons has caused you so much
trouble, Edith. We&mdash;we are unfortunate."</p>

<p>She turned away and went up stairs.</p>

<p>"Edith, I don't see how you can," exclaimed Cynthia. "Mamma had so much
trouble when she was a young girl, and she was so alone until she came
here, and now all this about Neal. Really, I don't see how you can."</p>

<p>And she ran after her mother.</p>

<p>Edith, left alone, was a prey to conflicting emotions. She knew she had
done wrong&mdash;very wrong. She was really sorry for the grief that Mrs.
Franklin was suffering on Neal's account, and she had not wanted to hurt
her.</p>

<p>"Of course, I did not intend her to hear me. How did I know she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_963" id="Page_963">[Pg 963]</a></span>
there? It makes me so angry to think that I can't do what I want."</p>

<p>That was the gist of the whole matter. Edith wanted her own way, and she
was determined to have it. She sat for a long time, thinking it all
over. She did not make any great effort to quench her resentment, and
so, of course, it became more intense. After a while she went to the
desk.</p>

<p>"I simply can't write him that I won't go," she said to herself. "How
they would all laugh if I said Mrs. Franklin 'had made other plans for
me,' as if I were Janet's age! No, I'll write Gertrude that I'll come
down and spend the day with her, and perhaps when I get there I can
induce Tony to play tennis, or something, instead of going to drive.
I'll try and get out of it, as long as I must, but I'm going to have a
good time of some sort."</p>

<p>She wrote the note, and it was sent to the Morgans' that night. Mrs.
Franklin supposed, of course, that it was merely to give up the drive;
so she was surprised when Edith announced that she was going to spend
the next day with Gertrude. However, she raised no objections, nor
indeed did she have any. Her mind was too full of Neal to think of much
else. Even the altercation with Edith failed to make any lasting
impression. Hester longed for her husband to return and tell her what he
had learned.</p>

<p>Cynthia did not take it so quietly.</p>

<p>"I think you are a goose, Edith," she said, the next morning. "Every one
will think you are running after Tony Bronson. You were there to dinner
yesterday, and now you are going again to-day."</p>

<p>Edith was greatly incensed.</p>

<p>"I am <i>not</i> running after him. How can you say such things? I often go
there two days in succession."</p>

<p>And she went off holding her head very high, being driven to the village
by Jack. Arrived at the Morgans', she was warmly greeted by all.</p>

<p>"So good of you to come," murmured Bronson; "now we can start from here
on our drive, and go over to Blue Hill."</p>

<p>"I think I can't go to drive to-day. I&mdash;I thought perhaps we could play
tennis instead."</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Edith! After your promise? I am not going to let you off so
easily. No, indeed; we are going to drive. It is a fine day, and I've
engaged a gay little mare at the livery-stable."</p>

<p>Edith remonstrated feebly, but Bronson would not listen.</p>

<p>When she and Gertrude were alone she said:</p>

<p>"Why don't you go too? We might all go to Blue Hill."</p>

<p>"No indeed!" laughed Gertrude. "I am not going a step. I haven't been
asked, and I wouldn't intrude."</p>

<p>"But it would be such fun," persisted Edith; "you know we used to go in
a crowd, and walk up the hill."</p>

<p>"Times have changed," returned her friend, pointedly. "This time you are
asked to go alone. If it were any one but you, Edith, I should be wildly
jealous."</p>

<p>Edith blushed and looked conscious, and afterwards when Bronson renewed
his pleading she consented to go with him. Unless they chanced to meet
some of the family, why need she tell that she had been to drive at all?</p>

<p>Thus she deceived herself into thinking that she was doing no wrong, and
gave herself up to the enjoyment of the moment.</p>

<p>That afternoon Mrs. Parker, Miss Betsey Trinkett's old friend, called at
Oakleigh.</p>

<p>"So glad to find you at home, Mrs. Franklin," she said. "I met Edith a
while ago, and she did look so sweet and pretty, driving with that nice
young man that stays at the Morgans'. What's his name?"</p>

<p>"You cannot mean Mr. Bronson?"</p>

<p>"Bronson, yes; that's it&mdash;Bronson. Yes, they were driving away over
towards Milton. And now do tell me about your brother. They say all
kinds of things in Brenton, but you can't believe half of them. I dare
say you know just where he is, after all."</p>

<p>"My brother went to Philadelphia, Mrs. Parker," said her hostess,
controlling herself with difficulty. The shock of hearing that Edith had
directly disobeyed her was almost too much for her.</p>

<p>"To Philadelphia! Have you friends there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have a cousin."</p>

<p>"Well, now, I'm glad to hear that! I'll just tell people and stop their
tongues; they do say so much they don't mean. Why, only this afternoon
somebody said they'd been told that Neal Gordon had been seen walking
over the Boston road. That's the very reason I came up here, to see if
it was true, and here he is away off in Philadelphia!"</p>

<p>"The Boston road?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and to think of his being in Philadelphia all the time! Well, I
must be going, Mrs. Franklin. Edith did look sweet. You dress her so
prettily. I always did think those girls needed a mother. Here's
Cynthia."</p>

<p>Walking up across the green from the river came Cynthia, with a paper in
her hand which she was reading. At sight of Mrs. Parker and her mother
standing at the carriage door, she hastily thrust the paper into her
pocket.</p>

<p>Cynthia had been after wild-flowers to plant in the bed she had for
them. She was in the woods not far from home when a small and ragged boy
approached her.</p>

<p>"Be you Cynthy?" he asked.</p>

<p>She looked up from her digging, startled.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>"Then here's for yer, and yer not to tell nobody."</p>

<p>So saying, the messenger disappeared as rapidly and mysteriously as he
had come.</p>

<p>Cynthia opened the crushed and dirty paper, and to her astonishment
found Neal's handwriting within.</p>

<p>"Meet me on Brenton Island near the bridge, Tuesday, as early as you
can. And don't tell I am here. Remember, <i>don't tell</i>."</p>

<p>The last words were heavily underlined.</p>

<p>Cynthia's heart stood still from excitement. Neal so near, and his
sister not to know it! But she would prevail upon him to come home. He
could not refuse her after all they had been through on his account.</p>

<p>Full of hope, she gathered up her trowel and her basket of plants and
ran towards the house. Fortunately that tiresome Mrs. Parker was there,
and so her mother would not notice her excitement. For once Cynthia was
glad to see the lady. Since her escapade of the year before she had
always been somewhat ashamed of meeting her.</p>

<p>An hour or two later a closed carriage came slowly up the avenue. Dennis
Morgan was on the box with the coachman. Inside were Gertrude, Dr.
Farley, and Edith, and Edith was unconscious.</p>

<h3>BY WILLIAM HAMILTON GIBSON.</h3>

<p>Of all the insects which occasionally claim our attention in our country
rambles, there is probably no example more entitled to our distinguished
consideration than the plebeian, commonly despised, but admittedly
amusing beetle known the country over as the funny "tumble-bug." As we
see him now, so he has always been the same in appearance, the same in
habits, yet how has he fallen from grace! how humbled in the eyes of man
from that original high estate when, in ancient Egypt, he enjoyed the
prestige above all insects, where, as the sacred "scarab&aelig;us," he was
dignified as the emblem of immortality, and worshipped as a god! The
arch&aelig;ological history of Egypt is rich in reminders of his former
eminence. Not only do we see his familiar shape (as shown in our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_964" id="Page_964">[Pg 964]</a></span>
initial design) everywhere among those ancient hieroglyphs engraved in
the rock or pictured on the crumbling papyrus; but it is especially in
association with death and the tomb that his important significance is
emphasized. The dark mortuary passages and chambers hewn in solid rock
often hundreds of feet below the surface, where still sleep the mummied
remains of an entire ancient people, and which honeycomb the earth
beneath the feet of the traveller in certain parts of Egypt, are still
eloquent in tribute to the sacred scarab. The lantern of the antiquarian
explorer in those dark dungeons of death discloses the suggestive figure
of this beetle everywhere engraved in high relief upon the walls,
perhaps enlivened with brilliant color still as fresh as when painted
three thousand years ago, emblazoned in gold and gorgeous hues upon the
sarcophagus and the mummy-case within, and again upon the outer covers
of the winding-sheet, finally, in the form of small ornaments the size
of nature, beautifully carved on precious stones enclosed within the
wrappings of the mummy itself.</p>

<p>What other insect has been thus glorified and immortalized? For the sake
of its proud lineage, if nothing else, is not our poor tumble-bug
deserving of our more than passing attention? An insect which has thus
been distinguished by an entire great people of antiquity has some
claims on our respect and consideration.</p>

<p>But aside from his historical fame, he will well repay our careful
study, and serve to while away a pleasant hour in the observance of his
queer habits. He is now no longer the awe-inspiring sacred scarab, but
Mr. Tumble-bug, or rather "Mr. and Mrs. Tumble-bug," for a tumble-bug
always pictured in the ancient hieroglyph is rarely to be seen in its
natural haunts. Mr. and Mrs. Tumble-bug are devoted and inseparable, and
as a rule vie with each other in the solicitude for that precious
rolling ball with which the insects are always associated. From June to
autumn we may find our tumble-bugs. There are a number of species
included in the group of Scarab&aelig;us to which they belong. Two species are
particularly familiar, one of a lustrous bronzy hue, with a very rounded
track, usually found at work on the country highway in the track of the
horse, and the other, the true typical tumble-bug, a flat-backed,
jet-black lustrous species which we naturally associate with the
barn-yard and cow-pasture. The latter may be taken as an illustrative
example of his class, and his ways are identical with that of his
ancient sacred congener and present inhabitant of Egypt.</p>

<span class="caption">MR. AND MRS. TUMBLE-BUG ROLLING THE BALL.</span>
</div>

<p>When we first see them they are generally manipulating the ball&mdash;a small
mass of manure in which an egg has been laid, and which by rolling in
the dust has now become round and firmly incrusted and smooth. Let us
follow the couple in their apparently aimless though no less expeditious
and vehement labors. They have now brought their globular charge through
the grassy stubble, and have reached a clear spot of earth with
scattered weeds. Of course we all know from the books that their
intention is to find a suitable spot in which to bury this ball, and
such being the case, with what astonishing stupidity do they urge on
that labor! Here certainly is just the right spot for you, Mrs.
Tumble-bug! Stop rolling and dig! But no, she will not listen to reason.
She mounts the top of the ball, and, creeping far out upon it, pulls it
over forward with her back feet, while Mr. Tumble-bug helps her in a
most singular fashion. Does he stand up on his hind legs on the opposite
side, and push with his powerful front feet? Oh no; he stands on his
head, and pushes with his hind legs. As he pushes, and as the ball rolls
merrily on, Mrs. Tumble-bug is continually rolled around with it, and
must needs climb backwards at a lively rate to keep her place. A foot or
two is thus travelled without special incident, when a slight trouble
occurs. The ball has struck an obstacle which neither Mrs. Tumble-bug's
pull nor Mr. Tumble-bug's push can overcome. Then follow an apparent
council and interchange of Tumble-bug talk, until at length both put
their shovel-shaped heads together beneath the sphere, and over it goes
among the weeds. It is soon out again upon the open. Now, Mrs.
Tumble-bug, everything is plain-sailing for you; here is a long down
grade over the smooth clean dirt! Why, the ball would roll down itself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_965" id="Page_965">[Pg 965]</a></span>
if you would only let it; but, no, she will <i>not</i> let it. She pauses,
and the ball rests, and both beetles now creep about, shovelling up the
dirt here and there with their very queer little flat heads. Ah, perhaps
they are going to start that <i>hole</i> which all the books tell us about.
But no; the place is evidently not quite satisfactory, both of them seem
so to conclude, like two souls with but a single thought. Mrs. T. is up
on the bridge in a jiffy, and Mr. T. takes his place at the helm; and
now what an easy time they will have of it down this little slope; but,
no, again; tumble-bugs don't seem to care for an easy time. A hundred
times on their travels will they pass the very best possible spot for
that burrow, a hundred times will they persist in guiding that little
world of theirs over an obstruction, when a clear path lies an inch to
the right or left of them. And here, when their labors might be so
easily lightened by a downward grade, what do they do? they deliberately
turn the ball about and hustle it along <i>up hill</i>, and that too over
dirt that is not half as promising. Up they go! Mrs. T. now seems to
have the best of it, and I sometimes have my suspicions whether she is
not playing a prank on that unsuspecting spouse working so hard at her
back, for he now has not only the ball, but Mrs. T. as well, to shove
along, for the most that she can do is to throw the weight of her body
forward, which in a steep up grade amounts to nothing as a help.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/ill_010.jpg" width="250" height="400" alt="SINKING THE BALL." title="" />
<span class="caption">SINKING THE BALL.</span>
</div>

<p>But if she is imposing on Mr. T. in thus guiding the ball up hill, she
soon gets the Roland for her Oliver. Mr. T. is put to great extra labor
by this whimsical decision of hers, and woe to Mrs. T. when that little
chance valley or inequality of surface is reached. Even though she can
see it coming and holds the wheel, she rarely seems to take advantage of
it to save herself or her ship, while Mr. T., going backward in the
rear, of course cannot be expected to know what is coming, nor be blamed
for the consequences. With kick after kick from his powerful hind feet,
united with the push of his mighty pair in front, the ball speeds up the
slope. Now for some reason he gives a backward shove of more than usual
force when it was least necessary. The ball had chanced upon the crest
of a slope, when, kick! over it goes with a pitch and a bound, and Mrs.
T. with it, though this time not on top. Happy is she if the ball simply
rolls upon her and pins her down. Such, indeed, is a frequent episode in
her experience of keeping the ball arolling, but occasionally the
tumble-ball thus started, and out of the control of her spouse at the
rear, may roll over and over for a long-distance, but never alone. No
amount of demoralization of this sort ever surprises her into losing her
grip on her precious globular bundle. When at last it fetches up against
a stone or stick, and she assures herself that she and her charge are
safe and sound, no doubt she immediately mounts to its crest to signal
the lone Mr. T. afar off, who is quickly back of her again, and both are
promptly off on a fresh journey. And so they keep it up, apparently for
sport, perhaps for an hour.</p>

<p>At length when they have played long enough&mdash;for there is no other
reason apparent to <i>homo sapiens</i>&mdash;they decide to plant their big dirty
pellet. The place which they have chosen is not half as promising as
many they have passed, but that doesn't seem to matter. Mrs. T. has
said, "It shall go here," and that ends it.</p>

<p>Then follows the most singular exhibition of excavation and burial. The
ball is now resting quietly on the dirt, and the two beetles are
apparently rummaging around beneath it, trying the ground with the sharp
edge of their shovel-shaped faces. And now, to avoid confusion, we will
dismiss Mr. T., and confine our observation strictly to the female, who
usually (in my experience) conducts the rest of the work alone.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 143px;">

<span class="caption">YOUNG TUMBLE-BUG DIGGING OUT FROM HIS DUNGEON.</span>
</div>

<p>She has evidently found a spot that suits her, and we expect her to
fulfil the directions of the books and entomological authorities. She
must "dig a deep hole first, and then roll the ball into it, and fill it
up again." But we will look in vain for such obedience. Instead of this
she persists in ploughing around beneath the ball, which seems at times
almost balanced on her back, until all the earth at this point is soft
and friable, and she is out of sight under it. Presently she appears
again at the surface, and as quickly disappears again, this time going
in upside down beneath the ball, which she pulls downward with her pair
of middle feet, while at the same time with hind legs and powerful
digging front legs she pushes outward and upward the loose earth which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_966" id="Page_966">[Pg 966]</a></span>
she has accumulated. Visibly the ball sinks into the cavity moment by
moment as the earth is lowered for a space of half an inch in the
surrounding soil, and continually forced upward outside of its
circumference. In a few moments the pellet has sunk level with the
ground, and in a few moments more the loose earth pushed upward has
overtopped it and it is out of sight. Still, for hours this busy
excavator continues to dig her hole and pull the ball in after her with
shovel head and molelike digging feet, scooping out a circular well much
larger than the diameter of the ball, which slowly sinks by its own
weight, aided by her occasional downward pull as this same loosened
earth is pushed upward above it. The burrow is thus sunk several inches,
when the beetle ploughs her way to the surface and is ready for another
similar experience.</p>

<p>The remaining history of the ball and its change is soon told. The egg
within it soon hatches, the larva finding just a sufficiency of food to
carry it to its full growth, when it transforms to a chrysalis, and at
length to the tumble-bug like its parent. The formerly loose earth above
him is now firmly packed, but he seems to know by instinct why those
powerful front feet were given to him, and he is quickly working his way
to the surface, and in a day or so is seen in the barn-yard rolling his
ball as skilfully as his mother had done before him.</p>

<p>Such is the method always employed by the tumble-bug as I have seen him.
And yet I have read in many natural histories and have heard careful
observers claim that the hole is dug first and the ball rolled in.
Perhaps they vary their plan, but I doubt it. Here is a matter for some
of our boys and girls to look into.</p>

<h3>OUR PRIZE OFFER.</h3>

<p>The members of the Camera Club will notice that our competition this
year is confined to three subjects or classes&mdash;Marines, Landscapes, and
Figure Studies. All the prizes are in money, and there are ten prizes.
The members are not restricted as to the number of prints they may send
in, nor are they barred from any class. A member may compete in each of
the five classes, and has ten chances of winning a prize.</p>

<p>We want every Knight and Lady of our Camera Club to compete for these
prizes. We also want you to tell your friends about them, and get them
to join the Camera Club. A circular which tells all about the Club has
just been issued by Harper &amp; Brothers. It tells what the Club is for,
gives prospectus for the coming year, gives the formula for plain paper,
which so many of you have been writing about, and also gives the prize
offers, rules, etc., of the competition. Copies of the circular will be
sent to any member who applies for them, and we would like each member
to help in distributing them.</p>

<p>Last year but few Ladies of the <span class="smcap">Round Table</span> sent in pictures for the
prize competition. This year we want all the Ladies who belong to the
Camera Club to send in pictures. One of the Sir Knights who took a prize
last year was so encouraged by his success that he has been working
steadily all the year, and has made quite a good deal of money. A letter
received from him a few weeks ago states that he should never have
thought of making money with his camera if he had not won a prize, but
the ten-dollar check which he received for his picture suggested to him
that if he could take a picture good enough to win a prize he could take
good enough pictures to sell. He has made pictures of boats, of
children, of pets, of buildings in process of erection&mdash;in fact, of
anything which came in his way which he could get pay for, and the
result is that he has a snug sum in the bank, and looks on his camera as
a financial friend.</p>

<p>Working for a prize stimulates one to do his best, and even though one
should not be fortunate enough to win a prize the effort to excel will
not be lost. It will be a help in more ways than one. This year we hope
that at least half of the prizes will be carried off by our Ladies. A
camera is specially adapted to be a girl's companion and source of
pleasure. Cameras are now made so very light and compact that they are
no burden to carry, and if one uses films they are still lighter. Girls
as a rule are more careful workers than boys, and should therefore make
the best amateur photographers, for it takes care as well as skill to
produce a good picture.</p>

<p>Look over your pictures that you have made this summer, select those
which you think are the best, finish them up in a neat and tasteful
manner, and send them in before the competition closes. If you have none
which you think worthy of a prize, set about making some without delay.
If you do not win a prize you will have the benefit of careful
criticism, and will stand a better chance of winning another time.</p>

<p>Any questions in regard to the prizes, or about making pictures for the
competition, will be answered promptly.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Sir Knight Alfred C. Baker</span> encloses two very pretty waterscapes,
and asks the cause of the black marks near the edge of one of the
pictures, and also asks to have the pictures criticised, both from
a technical and artistic point. The black spots, as far as can be
judged from the finished print, seems to be caused by scratches on
the film. If so, the print can be trimmed just enough to cut them
off from the picture. The print which is numbered 141 is the
better picture. It has more contrast of light and shade, the
perspective is better. The old log in the foreground and the
stretch of shore give the effect of distances which the other
picture lacks. Another thing which makes this picture more
attractive than the other is the slight ripple on the water. It
has the same effect as do clouds in the sky. If Sir Alfred will
study the two prints he will readily see what is meant. No. 140
would be improved if about half an inch of the foreground were
trimmed away. No. 141 would make a very nice platinum print or
plain-paper print.</p></div>

<p>What must I wear? is a question quite often on girlish lips, and a
girl's satisfaction with herself depends a good deal on the answer to
it. Nobody enjoys being badly or strikingly dressed, and in this matter
I am much of the opinion of Mrs. John Hancock, the great lady whose
husband's signature stands out so splendidly on our Declaration of
Independence. Mrs. Hancock said in substance that she could not approve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_967" id="Page_967">[Pg 967]</a></span>
of a girl who was indifferent to her dress, nor of one who showed that
she was thinking about it, and that she was pleased with the effect she
made. A girl must not strut about like a vain peacock; she must wear her
clothes as the plant wears its flowers&mdash;unconsciously.</p>

<p>If you are sensible and clear-headed girls you will not wish to have
many frocks at once. A strong serviceable serge for every-day wear, a
pretty cashmere or silk for best, a simple white frock for evening, two
or three separate waists, and an extra skirt to relieve the serge, are
sufficient for the winter wardrobe of a well-dressed young girl. In
summer one requires more changes, but print and muslin and gingham
frocks are cheap, and, if neatly made, are always appropriate. Of
under-clothing have as simple a supply as you can take care of. The
dainty girl likes to be clothed in fresh and clean garments next the
skin, and where her clothing is not seen. These garments may be of fine
and nice material, but the school-girl and the young woman should avoid
elaborate frills and puffs and tucks, embroideries and laces, for these
are easily torn, and are hard upon the laundress. Of stockings a
half-dozen pairs are necessary, of handkerchiefs two or three dozen, and
of linen for the neck and wrists enough to insure one's personal perfect
neatness on every occasion. Gloves and shoes are important parts of a
young lady's outfit. Of the former two pairs, one for best and one for
common wear, will probably be enough to have at once, and of the latter,
if you can afford it, have three or four pairs, for out-door and in-door
uses. A young woman whose gloves and boots are good of their kind, and
in nice order, will always appear well dressed. A water-proof cloak, a
thick warm jacket, and two hats, one a toque, trim and dainty, the other
a wider and more picturesque affair, with a brim, and feathers, ribbons,
or flowers for trimming, will meet all exigencies. Don't wear birds or
wings on your hats. No <span class="smcap">Round Table</span> Lady must countenance the cruel
killing of little birds that her hat may be adorned in a barbaric
fashion. The prejudice humane people feel against the wearing of slain
birds does not extend to ostrich feathers.</p>

<h2>SOME CURIOUS FACTS CONCERNING HEARING.</h2>

<p>An inquiry was recently made in London as to the greatest distance at
which a man's voice could be heard, leaving, of course, the telephone
out of consideration. The reply was most interesting, and was as
follows: Eighteen miles is the longest distance on record at which a
man's voice has been heard. This occurred in the Grand Ca&ntilde;on of the
Colorado, where one man shouting the name "Bob" at one end his voice was
plainly heard at the other end, which is eighteen miles away. Lieutenant
Foster, on Parry's third arctic expedition, found that he could converse
with a man across the harbor of Port Bowen, a distance of 6696 feet, or
about one mile and a quarter: and Sir John Franklin said that he
conversed with ease at a distance of more than a mile. Dr. Young records
that at Gibraltar the human voice has been heard at a distance of ten
miles.</p>

<p>Sound has remarkable force in water. Colladon, by experiments made in
the Lake of Geneva, estimated that a bell submerged in the sea might be
heard a distance of more than sixty miles. Franklin says that he heard
the striking together of two stones in the water half a mile away. Over
water or a surface of ice sound is propagated with great clearness and
strength. Dr. Hutton relates that on a quiet part of the Thames near
Chelsea he could hear a person read distinctly at the distance of 140
feet, while on the land the same could only be heard at 76 feet.
Professor Tyndall, when on Mont Blanc, found the report of a pistol-shot
no louder than the pop of a champagne bottle. Persons in a balloon can
hear voices from the earth a long time after they themselves are
inaudible to people below.</p>

<h3>BY ALBERT LEE.</h3>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p>The Lion bowed in a dignified manner to the Gopher, and rapped on the
table again to bring the Parrots to order, and then the Gopher said,
very slowly and deliberately:</p>

<p>"When is a door not a door?"</p>

<p>The animals stared at one another, and whispered, and gazed up and down
the table as if they thought they might possibly derive inspiration from
the dishes. Tommy and the ex-Pirate said not a word. Presently the
Gopher repeated:</p>

<p>"When is a door not a door?"</p>

<p>But no one could guess, and after a few moments more of anxious and
strained silence the Gopher said:</p>

<p>"I suppose I shall have to tell you. A door is not a door when it is
ajar."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">THE ANIMALS ROARED WITH LAUGHTER AT THE GOPHER&#39;S JOKE.</span>
</div>

<p>The animals fairly roared and shrieked with laughter. They bellowed and
howled and pounded on the table, and the Gopher became so much affected
with appreciation of his own wit that he fell over backwards, and almost
stunned a Newfoundland puppy who was trying to get his nose above the
table to see what it was all about. Tommy had never realized before what
the expression "to roar with laughter" really signified, and he
concluded he never wanted to experience such a realization again. The
noise was so great that he had to put his fingers to his ears. When the
merriment had partially subsided, the little boy leaned over to the
ex-Pirate and said:</p>

<p>"I have heard that joke before; haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I have," answered the ex-Pirate, "many a time."</p>

<p>"It's an awfully old one, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I always suspected it was first gotten off in the Ark," said the
ex-Pirate, shaking his head knowingly; "but I did not know the Gopher
was responsible for it."</p>

<p>By this time the animals had recovered themselves, and some were
shouting to the Gopher for more jokes. He got up and protested that he
did not know any more; and then, suddenly pointing to the ex-Pirate, he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"He's a funny one. He can <i>recite</i> things!"</p>

<p>Thereupon the animals all gazed at the ex-Pirate, and the Lion said,
"Recite things."</p>

<p>The ex-Pirate never needed much urging to do this sort of thing, and so
when Tommy whispered to him to read the seventeenth chapter of his
autobiography which he knew his friend had in his pocket, and of which
the little boy had only heard the first few lines, the ex-Pirate arose,
and, bowing in his usual way to all his hearers, he pulled his
manuscript from his coat and began to read:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 11em;">The following day the sun rose up as usual from the East.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">The sea was calm, the sky was clear, the stormy winds had ceased;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">The <i>Black Avenger</i> sped along before a gentle breeze,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">And the starboard watch loafed on the deck in true piratic ease.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">I took my breakfast down below, and when I came on deck</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 11em;">(He called upon the Sun and Moon, and scandalized them both,)</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 11em;">And made the loafing pirates heave the halyards with a will.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">The <i>Black Avenger</i> sped along and ploughed the boiling sea,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">The rigging creaked, the sails stood out, the foam flew fast and free.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">The pirates gathered on the deck and buckled on their swords,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 12em;">But suddenly the Bo's'n came a-rushing up to me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">His face was pale, his nose was red, he spoke: "Good sir," said he,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 11em;">We'll find she is not what she seems, as soon as we get near;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">She looks to me as though she might&mdash;might be a privateer"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">(But when he found she wasn't one, he shed a private tear.)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">Said I: "Load up the cannons, boys, with ten-pound cannon-balls;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">I care not what yon ship may be, into my hands she falls!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">We'll take her, and we'll take her guns, her captain, and her crew,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Her cook, her cabin steward, and her precious cargo, too!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">So the Gunner and the Gunner's Mate they lifted up the hatch,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">And they called upon the pirates who formed the starboard watch</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">To help them lift the cannon-balls from out the magazine</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Where all the cannon-balls were kept, wrapped up in bombazine.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">But presently the Gunner's Mate came rushing to the rail,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">His hair was standing up on end, his face was very pale,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">He cried: "Oh, Captain, woe is me, no cannon-balls are left;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Of shot and shell of every kind the magazine's bereft.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">There's not a piece of shrapnel, no canister or grape,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">There's not enough of buckshot to kill a good-sized ape!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">The Bo's'n, who stood near at hand, gazed sadly at us both,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">And then he pulled his pistols out and swore a mighty oath:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">"How shall we take yon Switzer ship," he said, "without a shell?"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">"We've <i>got</i> to fight," I answered him. "Won't cheese do just as well?"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">For, two days previously, you know, we met a brigantine</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">From Amsterdam for Zululand, by name the <i>Bandoline</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">And in her hold she carried a fine cargo, if you please,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Consisting of a hundred thousand dozen Edam cheese.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">We took a hundred dozen and stowed them on the poop</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Between the after cannon and the Captain's chicken-coop.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">(The crew had used the cheeses and some bottles from the galley,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">The day before, to improvise a sort of bowling-alley.)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">Said I: "We'll take these Edam cheese and put them in the guns,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">And shoot them at the Switzer ship until she sinks or runs;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">For surely such proceeding will be worse than shot or shell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Just think of being <i>hit</i> with cheese&mdash;say nothing of the smell!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">The pirates laughed and vowed my scheme would give them lots of fun;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">And soon a big, red, round, Dutch cheese was rammed in every gun.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">It was not long before the <i>Black Avenger</i> came abreast</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">And hailed the ship from Switzerland with true piratic zest;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">But not a Switzer said a word, nor made they any sign,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">But all the sailors on the ship were ranged along in line,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">And leaned upon the starboard rail, with sunken pallid cheeks</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">As though they had not tasted food for six or seven weeks.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">The swarthy Bo's'n hailed again, and as no answer came</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">The Gunner's Mate averred it was high time to start the game.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">I spoke the word, and seven guns all loaded up with cheese</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Were fired at the Switzer ship as nicely as you please;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">And then a second volley went, and soon again a third.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">And when the smoke had cleared away we saw what had occurred.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Each cheese had hit the Switzer ship and flattened on her decks,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">The Switzer men were wading in the cheese up to their necks.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">We waited then to see what sort of fighting they would make,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">And wondered how much cheese these Switzer sailor-men could take.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">But as we waited silence came all o'er the Switzer craft,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">And not a seaman seemed to move, or forward or abaft.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">I called the Bo's'n to the bridge, and "Take the gig," said I;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">"Go board yon ship, where all is still, and learn the reason why."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">The Bo's'n quick got in the gig with sixteen of the crew,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">He took along a cannon and an Edam cheese or two,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">And half an hour he was gone, then slowly rowed he back;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">He said to me: "Good Captain," he sobbed, "alas, alack!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Upon that floating vessel there's no one left to fight;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">There's not a living creature, not a living thing in sight.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">No man remains to give reply to any kind of question:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">The Switzers ate up all the cheese, and died of indigestion."</span><br />
</p>

<p>There was another great demonstration of approval as soon as the
ex-Pirate had concluded, but Tommy paid little attention to the noise
this time, because he had become somewhat accustomed to it.</p>

<p>"You see," said the ex-Pirate, apologetically, "I could not very well
read anything like that&mdash;all about cheese&mdash;in the presence of the Welsh
Rabbit; could I?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," agreed Tommy; "but is it true that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I say," interrupted the Gopher, leaning in front of Tommy and
addressing himself to the ex-Pirate; "I know another joke now. I know
what the Bo's'n said to the Gunner's Mate when he told him to shoot at
the ship."</p>

<p>"Well, what did he tell him?" asked the ex-Pirate, incautiously.</p>

<p>"Cheese it!" shouted the Gopher, who was immediately seized with such a
violent fit of laughter that he fell under the table, and almost buried
himself under the pile of broken soup plates.</p>

<p>Although the Cascadilla School has not practised rowing so long as St.
Paul's, of which this Department spoke last week, it has made rapid
strides ever since the sport was introduced there two years ago, and now
boasts of a well-equipped navy. Owing to the school's location on Cayuga
Lake, aquatics will become the distinctive form of athletics there in
the future, although, as a member of the New York State Interscholastic
League, football and baseball teams are also put into the field. But it
is a good thing to have rowing developed in some of the preparatory
institutions, and I shall not regret to see some of the vast amount of
energy that now appears to be running riot in track athletics turned
into this new channel. Every large school situated near a watercourse or
a lake ought to add rowing to its list of sports, if it is possible to
do so.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/ill_017.jpg" width="700" height="433" alt="THE CASCADILLA CREW AND BOAT-HOUSE." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE CASCADILLA CREW AND BOAT-HOUSE.</span>
</div>

<p>The principal difficulty in the way of such progress at present lies in
the fact that so few schools have crews, that interscholastic contests
are hard to arrange. The Cascadilla oarsmen are fortunate in having the
Cornell crews to row against, and each year they get races with the
Freshmen and 'Varsity eights. Thus far they have secured no victories
over either of these rivals, but as the sport grows older with them they
should make a better showing from year to year. The Cascadilla commodore
is now negotiating with a school near Philadelphia that has taken steps
toward the organization of a crew, and it is possible that next summer
will witness the first of a series of interscholastic regattas between
these progressive institutions.</p>

<p>The same lack of a scholastic rival hampers rowing at St. John's
Academy, Delafield, Wisconsin, where the school eight have to seek as
their opponents the crews of Madison University. Last spring they
defeated the '97 crew by three lengths in an exciting race over the
Nagawicka course in the excellent time of 8 min. 3 sec. This victory was
all the more creditable from the fact that several of the Madison
'Varsity men had seats in the '97 boat. I have spoken of the rowing
which is done in the several schools mentioned to show that it is
possible for young men not yet in college to approximate the work
performed by older athletes. The Department has devoted space to the
description of the crews and their methods in the hope of encouraging
other institutions to take up the sport during the coming winter and
next spring. It is an excellent exercise, and a seat in the 'Varsity
boat is looked upon as the greatest athletic honor a college man may
attain, excepting, of course, a captaincy. It must be the same in every
school where rowing is practised, and the school that has a crew in the
spring is bound to have a better football team in the fall, for the
training done in the winter and the rowing done later develop new
material, and strengthen the older men.</p>

<p>The proposition to organize a National Interscholastic Athletic
Association, modelled upon the Inter-collegiate Association, made in
these columns in the early part of last spring, is looked upon favorably
not only by the schools and associations in this part of the country,
but also by the schools on the Pacific coast. In fact, the Westerners
have shown a much greater spirit of enterprise and sportsmanship in the
matter than have the managers of scholastic athletic interests in the
East. It is probable, however, that the apparent stagnation in this
quarter has been due to the summer vacation, and the consequent
cessation of school sports, and the absence from town of those who could
take hold of the scheme and put it through. Now that the fall term is
about to open, this matter promises to be taken up with the energy
required for such an undertaking, and all we need is the hearty
co-operation of the many interscholastic associations from every State
in the Union. On October 8th there will be a meeting of the New York
I.S.A.A., and I am assured that at that meeting the first steps towards
the formation of the National Interscholastic League will be taken.</p>

<p>Steps have already been taken in California toward joining the League as
soon as it shall be started, and the San Francisco newspapers are
already talking of it as though it were an accomplished fact. This is
all due to those lively young sportsmen of the Oakland High-School, who
are not only eager to enter a general association, but are anxious to
send a team of athletes to the Berkeley Oval to threaten the supremacy
of the Eastern schools in track and field sports. Here is what the San<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_970" id="Page_970">[Pg 970]</a></span>
Francisco <i>Call</i> of September 4th says on the subject:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Oakland High-School decided to-day that it would join the
National League of High-Schools, and send a team to New York next
year to join in the national High-School contests. The team will
consist of ten of the best athletes in the school, and the boys
anticipate being capable of holding their own and capturing some
of the trophies. They have received much encouragement from the
recent tour of the Berkeley team. The Oakland High-School has for
some time been a member of the league of which <span class="smcap">Harper's Round
Table</span> is the organ, and now that they have decided to branch out
and seek national honors, athletics will receive a boom, as there
is much rivalry as to who will ultimately be the ones chosen to
uphold the honor of Oakland's High-School in the Empire State. A
general meeting will be held in a few days, and a manager will be
elected who will at once put into practice all the available
material. After that the boys will commence to obtain pledges for
financial aid, as it will require about $1600 to defray the
expenses of the trip. The next national High-School contests will
be held in the summer; but entries are now being made, and Oakland
will not be dilatory in outlining the events for which she will
seek to carry off the honors. "The sending East of our team will
be one of the best things that ever the High-School undertook,"
said one of the O.H.-S. athletes to-day. "It will call attention
to our school and to Oakland, and will let thousands of people
know that we exist who are in doubt just now as to where Oakland
is. We have been debating the proposition of sending a team East
all this year, but after we saw what a lot of attention was shown
to the Berkeley team we could see no reason why we should not try
a similar tour among the crack Eastern High-Schools. We do not
anticipate any trouble in raising the necessary funds, as we think
the noise we shall make will prove a very valuable advertisement
for this city."</p></div>

<p>A good many of the statements made by the <i>Call</i> are inaccurate, but the
main announcement, that the O.H.-S. will come East, is authentic. It
behooves the Eastern sportsmen, therefore, to get ready to receive them.
As I have said before, the <span class="smcap">Round Table</span> will do everything in its power
to further the organization of a National Association of the schools,
and these columns are open to correspondents who care to make
suggestions for the advancement of the scheme. Perhaps a better idea of
what the Californians have actually done, and will do, can be obtained
from this letter, which came to the <span class="smcap">Round Table</span> from the Captain of the
O.H.-S. athletic team:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The newspaper reports are not at all accurate, but they will
serve to show what we have been doing lately. While they do not
convey the exact truth, they have aroused great enthusiasm among
the Oakland people, and we have great hopes of taking an Eastern
tour. We are only awaiting the formation of the Big League to go
right to work, and we have a big job on hand. I suppose that the
Field Day will be held about the latter part of June, and that the
list of events will be made to coincide exactly with the
Inter-collegiate programme. If we came East we could doubtless
make arrangements for a series of dual games with three or four of
the crack schools in the vicinity of New York in addition to the
Big Field Day. Of course this could all be arranged later on; what
we are worried about now is getting started. I wish you would prod
the schools up and get them to take immediate action. We want to
get to work right away, for to raise $3000 is quite a job. The
U.C. boys are in favor of the trip, and will help us in every way.
I wish you would inform us of any steps taken in this regard, and
also put us in touch with the officers, so we could correspond
with them. Would it be necessary to be the winning or champion
team of our league to join in the Field Day, or could the O.H.-S.
alone join the League and uphold the honor of California in the
scholastic world in the East?"</p></div>

<p>It strikes me that the New York I.S.A.A. will lose an opportunity that
may never offer again if it fails now to take the initiative in the
formation and foundation of the National Interscholastic Athletic
Association of America.</p>

<p>Lawrenceville opened last Thursday, and the football men went to work at
once. Some of the old players got back a week earlier, and saw to it
that the eight fields were put into shape and laid out, and now every
afternoon one may see sixteen elevens hard at work rushing and kicking
and otherwise developing new material. This system of requiring
everybody to join in the game is an excellent one. The boys at
Lawrenceville are arranged according to size, and are taught how to
play, and thus it is plain that in the course of a year or two the
Captain of the school team has plenty of good material to pick from. The
first and second teams have the additional advantage of being coached by
some of the instructors who were star football players in their college
days, and the benefit of whose experience goes largely toward making the
Lawrenceville eleven the successful one that it usually is.</p>

<p>Last year, for instance, Lawrenceville defeated the Hill School, 22-0,
the Yale Freshmen, 16-0, and Andover, 20-6, besides disposing of every
other school team they met. They tried to arrange a game with the
Princeton 'Varsity, but were not successful, for the reason, they
believe, that in 1893 they scored 4-8 on the orange and black champions.
Of course this is probably not the reason, for Princeton should be only
too glad to get such excellent practice even from a school team, and
this year no doubt there will be a match, and another probably with the
University of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>A feature of the football record of this school, which it is pleasing to
be able to call attention to, is that in the twelve years the game has
been played there no dispute has ever arisen and no serious accident has
occurred. Moreover, as far as I am able to ascertain, no boy ever went
to the school because he could play football. All this tends to create a
genuine and healthy interest in the sport, and not only the scholars
themselves, but the graduates of the school take pride in such a record.
This is shown by the fact that the Alumni have presented a $300 cup for
class championship contests, each winning class getting its numeral
engraved upon the trophy; and an alumnus has also offered a cup to be
played for by the House teams, and to become the property of the House
winning the greatest number of times within ten years. The boys live in
Houses at Lawrenceville, as they do at Rugby and Harrow, and each House
has its eleven.</p>

<p>Of last year's first school team five men return: Emerson, full-back;
Dibble and Davis, half-backs; Cadwalader and Edwards, guards. This is a
first-rate nucleus, and Dibble, the new Captain, is expected to bring
forward a team equal, if not superior, to that of last year. There are
few better half-backs in the schools than Dibble. He is a great
sprinter, having covered the 100 in 10 seconds at the school games last
June. Davis, the other half-back, and Emerson, the full-back, will
surely improve this fall over their last year's style, while no better
guards are necessary than Cadwalader and Edwards. They weigh 210 and 218
pounds respectively.</p>

<p>The candidates for end rush are Noble and Righter, and unless some new
phenomenons develop, they will hold the positions. The tackles will have
to be taken from the incoming classes, and the hardest position to fill
will be quarter-back. Captain Dibble may well watch the play of the man
in this position, if he expects the team to be engineered as well as De
Saulles did it last year. De Saulles is a wonderful quarter-back, and
will no doubt make the Yale 'Varsity in a year or so. A large number of
new Fourth Form boys, or Seniors, have been entered this fall, and it
will be strange if in a school of 350 enough available material cannot
be trained to bring the eleven up to its usual standard of excellence.</p>

<p>The teams of the New England League are also in the field, and in a few
days practice games between schools will begin. Boston Latin is
scheduled to meet Charlestown High to-morrow, and English High meets
Dorchester on the same day. There is unusual promise of good new
material everywhere, and the championship matches ought to furnish good
football. Only three members of the Cambridge Manual Training School's
champion eleven are back this fall, and the candidates for positions are
mostly small, light men. Captain Murphy, however, has signified his
intention of trying to make up for the probable lightness of his team by
perfecting it in team work.</p>

<p>The Boston Latin School was the first to get its men into training, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_971" id="Page_971">[Pg 971]</a></span>
has a start of nearly a week over its rivals. Many of last year's
players have returned to school, and most of them are heavy fellows.
Lowe, one of the guards, is the biggest man of the aggregation, and
weighs 210 pounds. Eaton at centre weighs 198 pounds, and his other
guard, Nagle, tips the scales at 185. These three have played together
for B.L.S. for the past three years, and are undoubtedly the strongest
centre in the League. The tackle positions are open, and one of them
will probably be filled by Rankin, who was a substitute last year. D.
Lockin, who showed some of the best end work of any of the school
players, is back in his old position.</p>

<p>Captain Maguire will keep his old place at full-back, and ought to
manage to develop a strong eleven. He is familiar with the fine points
of the game, and has been a member of the team for two years past. Last
year he proved himself one of the cleverest ground-gainers in the
League, and in the game with English High his punting aided materially
toward the securing of victory. His tackling and interfering have
improved, and will doubtless grow better as the season advances.</p>

<p>The showing made in the early work of the English High-School players
has not been very encouraging thus far. Like the C.M.T.S. men, the
candidates are small, but all of them are apparently hard workers. It is
fortunate for Captain Callahan that there are not so very many positions
to fill, but on the other hand the vacancies occur in places where
strong and reliable players are required. If things are allowed to run
along in the slipshod way that characterized E.H.-S.'s endeavors last
year, however, the team will be a poorer one than has represented the
school for some time. Only continuous and careful work can bring the
team into championship form.</p>

<p>The two scholastic representatives in the A.A.U. championships at
Manhattan Field on the 14th managed to hold their ends up pretty well.
Baltazzi took second to Sweeney in the high jump, with 5 feet 10-1/2
inches, defeating Cosgrove, and Syme got first in the low hurdles. He
ran his trial heat in 26-3/5 seconds, but got the medal with 28-1/5
seconds. His victory was in some respects a repetition of his success at
Syracuse in the Metropolitan championships. There he met Sheldon and
Chase, the latter falling over the eighth hurdle. At Manhattan Field,
Cosgrove led up to the ninth hurdle in the trials, and then took a
cropper, leaving Syme to win the heat. In the finals, Syme and Cady had
it neck and neck to this same ninth, when the scholastic runner struck
the timber so heavily as to break it, but recovered in time to see Cady
go somersaulting over the tenth. Before the Yale man could recover, Syme
had breasted the tape.</p>

<h2>A NEW USE FOR A DOLL.</h2>

<p>A new use for a doll has been discovered by an ingenious London thief. A
woman who was arrested for stealing from one of the large dry-goods
shops was found to have been carrying what everybody supposed to be a
baby; but what in reality turned out to be a huge doll with a wax face
and hollow leathern body. It was the thief's custom to conceal the
stolen articles as quickly as she got her fingers on them, gloves,
laces, and so forth, in the cavernous and spacious interior of the
"baby."</p>

<h2>SOME STRANGE VISITING-CARDS</h2>

<p>Calling in Corea must be a very difficult performance, if, as a London
journal has recently stated, the ordinary visiting-cards there are a
foot square. The same journal goes on to say that the savages of Dahomey
announce their visits to each other by a wooden board or the branch of a
tree artistically carved. This is sent on in advance, and the visitor,
on taking leave, pockets his card, which probably serves him for many
years. The natives of Sumatra also have a visiting-card, consisting of a
piece of wood about a foot long and decorated with a bunch of straw and
a knife.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>SOME NOVEL RACES.</h2>

<p>A London newspaper some years ago contained an account of a strange sort
of contest which two noblemen once got up for their own amusement. It
consisted of matching a flock of turkeys and a flock of geese for a race
on the London and Norwich road, in the middle of the last century. The
turkeys would insist upon flying up into the roadside trees to roost
while the geese, keeping up a steady waddle till night, reached London
from Norwich two days ahead. The same journal also mentions the feats of
the Hon. Tom Coventry's sprinting pig. In 1803 this speedy animal was
matched against a celebrated runner, and started a strong favorite on
the day of the race which she won with ease. The pig had been trained to
run the distance each day for its dinner. Another strange contest of
this time took place between two sporting noblemen, who raced against
each other on a windy day on Hampstead Heath, one running backwards in
jack-boots, and the other holding up an open umbrella, and running
forwards.</p>

<p>The third stage of the trip from New York to Boston by the shore road
demands our attention this week. It extends from New Haven to New
London, a distance of forty-five miles or more, and though the rider
can, if he desires, stop at Saybrook, thirty-three miles distant from
New Haven, it is wiser to make the run to New London in one day, as the
accommodations at New London are better, and the next stage, from New
London to Shannuck, which comes on the next day, is much lighter.</p>

<p>Leaving New Haven and going eastward the rider should keep always to the
right on going into the suburbs of the city, and continue to the south
of Fair Haven through East Haven. One and a half or two miles out of
East Haven the road crosses the railroad track, and then runs on another
mile into Branford, which is eight miles from New Haven. From Branford
the road is, in the main, easily followed, the general tendency being to
keep in the vicinity of the railroad, and near the shore of Long Island
Sound. It is well for the rider, where possible, outside of villages, to
take the side path, as the road is not in the best of condition in
certain places, and the side path is usually very good. From Branford to
Stony Creek is a distance of about three miles. Thence to Leetes Island,
two miles further, where the road is clear, there is little to be
described. There are almost no hills of importance, and the side path
usually offers a very good substitute for the road itself when the
latter becomes sandy.</p>

<p>From Leetes Island to Guilford, about three miles further on, the road
winds about a good deal, crossing the railroad track twice before
entering Guilford in order to make a detour to the north and cross a
creek. After leaving Guilford the road runs down close by the shore, and
keeps its position in passing East River and Madison. Between Madison
and Clinton, and between Clinton and Grove Beach, a distance altogether
of between five and six miles, the road is fair in general and very poor
in spots. The side path should be taken wherever available, but,
everything considered, it is not one of the best bicycle roads that
could be desired. From Grove Beach into Saybrook, a distance of six
miles, the rider passes through Westbrook, and the road does not alter
its condition, being in the main fair, but very sandy in spots.</p>

<p>If possible, the rider should start from New Haven early in the morning,
and make Saybrook some time about noon, stopping there for lunch or
dinner. This is a distance of thirty-three miles altogether. To be sure,
it only leaves a run of thirteen or fourteen miles to New London, but
the accommodations there are so much better than along the line that it
is advisable to try and reach it, and at the same time it is always well
to do more than half the journey in the morning. Leaving Saybrook the
rider should proceed, still on the turnpike, to the Connecticut River
bank at Lyme Ferry. Crossing by this he turns to the right and runs into
Lyme over a capital road. Thence the road runs along over a reasonably
good bit of country to the north of the railroad into South Lyme, five
miles further on, with the exception of a spot a mile or more beyond
Black Hall, where the road crosses a creek and is poor riding for a
short space. From South Lyme to Niantic is about three miles, and after
passing East Lyme, a short distance out of Niantic, the rider crosses a
long bridge over an inlet of the Sound. From this point, keeping to the
left just after crossing the bridge, he runs through Jordanville into
New London, and may there put up at the Crocker House in the middle of
the town.</p>

<p>There are several alternatives over the last part of the course. For
example, after crossing the Lyme Ferry and passing through Lyme, instead
of keeping to the right it is possible for the rider to turn to the
left, and follow the secondary bicycle route marked on the map, which,
on the whole, is neither as short nor as good riding as the other. The
road passes through Graniteville and joins the turnpike-road near
Jordanville. In the case of a strong head wind, especially if it is a
little to the southward of east, it will save a great deal of time and
labor for the rider to take this more inland route. On the southern
route, after passing Niantic and East Lyme and crossing the long bridge,
the rider may turn sharp to the right, follow the route marked on the
map, crossing another inlet of the Sound, leaving Jordanville on the
north, and thence run on to the mouth of the Thames River, where he can
put up at the Pequot House, a summer hotel, which will be a welcome
place after such a ride.</p>

<p>The New York <i>Herald</i> states that the Duke of York is prepared to sell
his very valuable collection of stamps to the highest bidder. Lord
Rothschild has made the most liberal offer thus far, but he would prefer
to buy the rarest specimens only.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">C.&nbsp;E. Abbey</span>.&mdash;U.&nbsp;S. stamps are printed on plates of 200 or 400
stamps divided into <i>panes</i> of 100 stamps each. A sheet of 100
stamps as sold by the Post-Office is one of these panes. Every
plate bears a number, and this number is printed on the margin of
each pane. For instance, the current 2c. red is printed from
plates of 400 stamps which, after printing, is cut into four
sheets. I illustrate plate No. 112.</p>

<p>I know of no stamp chapter in Newark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H.&nbsp;B. Thaw</span>.&mdash;The 12 sen 1875, Japan, is worth 70c., the 15 sen,
same issue, 60c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">L.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C</span>.&mdash;Dealers quote two varieties of the half-dime of 1838,
one at 10c., the other at 30c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. Whittemore</span>.&mdash;No stamp was found in your envelope when opened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;S</span>.&mdash;The stamps are Costa Rica revenues. There are several
varieties of U.&nbsp;S. 1c. Proprietary worth from 1c. to 10c. each.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.&nbsp;K. Morlan</span>.&mdash;The current 1s. Great Britain postage-stamp is
catalogued at 2c. if used. As there are many thousand varieties of
North, Central, and South American stamps, I cannot quote values,
but advise you to buy a catalogue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.&nbsp;H. Maurer</span>.&mdash;The $1 values of U.&nbsp;S. postage-stamps are largely
used to pay postage on packages of bonds sent from the U.&nbsp;S. to
Europe. The "pink" 1861 is extremely rare. It is a peculiar shade
which cannot be described in words.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H.&nbsp;L. Watson</span>, Paris.&mdash;It is probably a fraud. The only Jones
Express known in America bears Washington's portrait, and is
printed on pink paper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A.&nbsp;E. Barrow</span>.&mdash;No coins enclosed. I cannot say what dealers will
pay for stamps. That depends on scarcity, condition, and quantity.
An unsevered pair of any scarce stamp is always worth more than
two single stamps of the same kind. The Columbus and 1853 dollars
can both be bought from dealers at a slight advance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.&nbsp;E. Porte</span>r.&mdash;The coin is a Connecticut cent dated 1787. Dealers
catalogue it at 15c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.&nbsp;T. Delano</span>.&mdash;What dealers pay for coins we do not know. You can
buy the 1832 half-dollar in good condition for 75c., the 1853
quarter for 35c., the 1864 two-cent copper for 10c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.&nbsp;S. Bidwell, Jun</span>.&mdash;No premium on the shilling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.&nbsp;B. Tripp</span>.&mdash;Dealers quote the 1857 and 1858 cents at 5c. each,
1822 half-dollar at 75c., silver three-cent pieces at 10c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. Martin</span>.&mdash;Levant stamps are used for local purposes, and for
prepayment of postage on letters to the home countries.</p></div>

<h2>Help for those Lovers of Figures.</h2>

<p>Answers to the Turk and Christian and Valet problems published last
week: 1. Turk and Christian Puzzle.&mdash;In the Latin sentence and French
verse given, attention must be given to the vowels <i>a</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>o</i>,
<i>u</i> contained in the syllables, letting <i>a</i> equal one, <i>e</i> two, <i>i</i>
three, <i>o</i> four, and <i>u</i> five. Begin by arranging four Christians
together, because the vowel in the first syllable is <i>o</i>; then five
Turks, because the vowel in the second syllable is <i>u</i>, and so on to the
end. By proceeding in this manner, it will be found, taking every ninth
person circularly, beginning at the first of the row, that the lot will
fall entirely on the Turks.</p>

<p>2. Valet Puzzle.&mdash;Two valets cross first, and one of them, rowing back,
carries over the third valet. One of the three valets then returns with
the boat, and, remaining, allows the two masters whose valets have
crossed to go over in the boat. One of the masters then carries back his
valet, and leaving him on the bank, rows over the third master. In the
last place, the valet who crossed enters the boat, and, returning twice,
carries over the other two valets.</p>

<h2>Wants a Round Table Reunion.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Those of us who were in Boston during the week of the Templars'
Conclave will never forget the parade. Twenty-five thousand men,
with the motto, "Fraternity," "Fidelity," "Charity," marched from
eleven o'clock in the morning to six in the evening. The flying
banners, emblematic signs, playing bands, and general feeling of
good-fellowship all combined to make one wish that the Round Table
could have some similar convention. We have the same friendly
feeling towards each other; we have emblems; we have Chapters; and
we have a hundred thousand members.</p>

<p>What could we not do in a three days' convention? We could hold
our all-round athletic championship tournament for the gold medal;
we could have an exhibition of the Table's handicraft work; we
could organize and have a "Grand Master," as the Templars have;
and think how it would "boom" the membership and promote
good-fellowship. I, for one, am in favor of holding a convention
this year in New York, and several of my correspondents hold the
same ideas. If some one with a "planning head" will "take hold"
and develop my ideas I will be glad to hear from them.</p></div>

</p>

<p>We print this morsel because it is full of praiseworthy enthusiasm. We
fear that our Order could not accomplish what an old fraternity is able
to. But what say all of you?</p>

<h2>Questions and Answers.</h2>

<p>It is not known, dear Sir Knight Latham, who was the wearer of the Iron
Mask. There are many theories, but no positive knowledge. F.W.L.
Bunting, Abbott Street, Cairns, Queensland, Australia, is a Knight who
is fond of letter-writing, and a stamp collector in for trading. He
wants to hear from you. Charles E. Abbey, Chester, N.&nbsp;J., asks if James
Dixon, a former prize-winner in one or two of our contests, will write
him. He wants to trade minerals and stones with anybody.</p>

<p>Edith Cline, Lewisberry, Pa., waits to receive a ribbon with your name,
address and date. She will send hers. Edith F. Morris is now secretary
of the Durham Stamp Exchange. Her address is 213 Third Avenue, New York.
J. Crispia Bebb is informed that there has been no change in the Table's
colors. We regret you can find no other Knights in Seattle. Ask for some
blank Patents and give them to friends. Maybe when they read on the last
page of the Patent the advantages of the Table they will consent to let
you fill out a Patent for them.</p>

<p>Fred G. Patterson, Markleton, Pa., had a live rattlesnake which he was
willing to sell to the highest bidder, the proceeds to go to the School
Fund. His best bid at writing was $5. Wonder what he got, and how the
snake is doing in captivity by this time? Sir John H. Campbell sends us
the yells and colors of Vanderbilt University at Nashville, Tenn.:</p>

<p>"Vanderbilt! 'Rah, 'Rah, 'Rah! Whiz, Boom! Zip, Boom! 'Rah, 'Rah, 'Rah!"
The colors are old-gold and black.</p>

<h2>The Helping Hand.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I want to make a suggestion how the members in this city can raise
some money for the Fund. It is to give a "trolley party." I
suppose you know what a trolley party is. A party of young people
charter a car for the evening, and ride all over the city and into
the suburbs. The trolley party is a craze in this city at present.
It is very common to see strings of illuminated cars coming down
the streets in twos, generally accompanied by a band of music. It
was not long ago I saw a large trolley party of sixty-five cars
one after each other; This party was for the benefit of the German
Hospital, and was a great success.</p>

<p>Don't you think a trolley party could be gotten up in this city if
all the members were in real sympathy with the Order's work? I
think we could easily give a trolley party, say, some week in
October. Mr. Patton has consented to help me, and we want at least
three more members in this city aged about sixteen years. The cost
of a party varies according to the distance and the electrical
decorations.</p>

<p>There are several fine routes. Germantown, Chestnut Hill, Angora,
Darby, and Willow Grove. The two last ones are preferable on
account of the length of the lines. The cost is about $16 per car,
decorated. We need at least three things for a success
financially&mdash;united action on the part of the members, publicity,
and a good night.</p></div>

members who will go.</p>

<h2>Origin of Three Common Things.</h2>

<p>Some of our most common symbols have interesting derivations. Take, for
instance, the dollar sign ($), which every one knows and loves&mdash;to a
more or less extent. Several explanations have been given of its origin.
The most probable is that it is a modification of the figure 8, denoting
the famous "piece of eight" of pirate lore, a Spanish silver piece of
the value of our dollar. Another theory is that it represents the scroll
and pillars depicted on certain Spanish coins. Still another makes us
question whether it is not a monogram of the letters "U.S." It has even
been stated that this mark at one time appeared on the flag of
Saragossa, a city famous for its two months' siege by the French in
1808.</p>

<p>The symbol Rx, standing for <i>recipe</i>&mdash;take&mdash;was originally the symbol
for Jupiter, a sign placed at the head of a medical formula to
propitiate Jove, that the compound might act favorably. The character &amp;
is a corruption of the Latin word <i>et</i>, the letters being written as
one.</p>

<h2>Hunting Deer in California.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I wish you could see the picturesque spot where we are spending
the summer. We are in a deep ca&ntilde;on, surrounded by the Santa Cruz
Mountains, all of them over 2000 feet high. Llagas Creek, which
abounds in cataracts, runs through the ravine. But the attractive
feature of the place is that deer abounds on the hill-sides. The
season opened on the 15th of July. At three o'clock on that
morning thirteen hunters, dressed in leggings and corduroys,
mounted their horses and started out, followed by a large pack of
hounds, for the deer haunts.</p>

<p>The leader of the party in an hour's time had reached a convenient
spot and divided his men into sets of two or three, stationing
them in certain spots where the deer, scented by the dogs, would
be likely to pass. Within three hours' time we heard the crack of
rifles, and then the blowing of the horns brought us the joyful
news that the hunters had been successful. By eight o'clock the
party returned to the house, one of them leading on the back of a
horse a fine buck weighing 100 pounds, exclusive of head and
antlers. To-day we have been feasting from some choice bits, and
feel that though we did not do the shooting ourselves, we were
decidedly "in it."</p></div>

<h2>STORIES BY GRANDMA.</h2>

<h3>SOME TERRIBLE ADVENTURES WITH WOLVES.</h3>

<p>"Grandma," said Ralph, "what do you suppose Uncle Henry said?"</p>

<p>"Well," answered grandma, "it wouldn't surprise me if he said it was a
cold day, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No; I mean what do you suppose he told me; what kind of a story?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! your uncle Henry is <i>such</i> a hand to tell stories that I
could hardly guess. About animals, I suppose, though, and nothing
smaller than elephants, I'll warrant."</p>

<p>"No; wolves. They chased him once. Got away by climbing a tree and
pulling the tree up after him."</p>

<p>"Dear me! what an extraordinary occurrence!" exclaimed grandma.</p>

<p>"But do you <i>believe</i> it, grandma?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Oh no; certainly not. I never believe any of your uncle Henry's animal
stories."</p>

<p>"Well," said Ralph, slowly. "I've been a little afraid of some of them
myself. He <i>couldn't</i> pull up a tree he was in, <i>could</i> he, grandma?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe he could, unless he pulled pretty hard. I remember <i>my</i>
uncle Henry used to tell a wolf story when I was a little girl. He said
that one day, when he lived in Vermont, two wolves came after him, and
he ran as fast as he could. By-and-by he began to get tired. Just then
he came to a big rock, half as big as a house, and leaped upon it. The
wolves were close behind, and so furious that they were almost or quite
blind. One rushed around the rock one way, and the other the other way.
They met on the farther side, and each thought he had caught Uncle
Henry, and they began to fight like cats and dogs. Pretty soon they
stopped to rest, and saw their mistake, and Uncle Henry said he never
saw two wolves look so disgusted."</p>

<p>"Do you believe <i>that</i> story?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Well," answered grandma, "it does seem to have its hard points. I think
he may have stretched it a little."</p>

<p>"Tell me a true wolf story, grandma," pleaded Ralph.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't know any more wolf stories&mdash;except the one about
Little Red Riding-hood. Once on a time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've heard that, grandma. Tell me another about your uncle Henry."</p>

<p>"Well, another time, when Uncle Henry was living in Vermont a long time
ago, two wolves came and sat down on his door-step. His house was a
little log cabin with only one door. It was a very cold winter, with
deep snow, so there wasn't much for wolves to eat. These two wolves were
pretty hungry, and they thought that they would wait on the door-step
till Uncle Henry came out, and just eat him for dinner, and perhaps stir
around and get the stage-driver for supper, and depend on luck for
breakfast the next morning.</p>

<p>"Uncle Henry happened to look out of the window and saw the two wolves
sitting on the door-step; so he just staid in and said nothing. He staid
in and kept on saying nothing for two whole days, and still those wolves
sat there and waited for dinner to serve itself. They were friendly for
a long time, and sat facing each other, discussing the weather and other
things, I suppose; but after a while, when they began to get pretty
hungry, they had a little tiff, and turned their backs on each other.
Then Uncle Henry took a clothes-pin, reached through the crack under the
door, and slipped it on their tails where they crossed just as cool as
if he had been pinning a wet stocking on a clothes-line. It held their
tails together like a vise. 'Stop pinching my tail,' said one wolf.
'You&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Now, grandma!" broke in Ralph, reprovingly.</p>

<p>"I'm telling this story just as Uncle Henry told it to me when I was a
little girl. I don't suppose he meant that the wolf really <i>said</i> that
out loud, but <i>thought</i> it, and <i>looked</i> it. 'Let go my tail,' said one
wolf; and he scowled over his shoulder at the other. 'Quit pinching <i>my</i>
tail,' said the other; and <i>he</i> looked over <i>his</i> shoulder and scowled.
Then they sprang at each other, and began to fight as hard as they knew
how. Uncle Henry said he never heard such a noise in his life. But after
a while it became all still, and he went out; but he couldn't find
anything except a little wolf fur floating about in the air, and the
clothes-pin; so he concluded that they had either fought each other
completely out of existence, or got tired out and gone off."</p>
